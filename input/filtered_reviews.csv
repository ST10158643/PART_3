Wrongfully Billed by Telkom Telkom has been invoicing me for services not rendered. i had bought a router and subscribed to them for data.  They gave me services for a couple of months and then they disconnected my router. They have since then invoiced me on that router without services rendered to me. Now they want to ruin my credit score for money i don't owe them.,1,5,4
"Wish you have more employees like Lubabalo Dingani Lubabalo Dingani.  I logged into Hello Peter to complain about the poor service I have received in trying to get my line sorted out with telkom.  AS I was busy typing out the complaint I evenutally got through to Lubabalo.  I immediately asked to speak to a manager but Lubabalo assured me that he can sort out my complaint.  Please note, I have been trying for 6 months to get this sorted out.  I have been sent from pillar to post.  From billing to sales, from sales to billing, back and front for nearly 6 months.  I am now at a point where I finally think we are moving into the right direction.  I also have to give credit to Nokwanda mngona who also helped me into the right direction.  I hope that these 2 people will be used as an example to get your other staff on the same level.  If I could deal with them all the time I would have a pleasure doing business with you. I must however say that this probably equal to maybe 3% of your staff.  Your systems is failing your staff.  Your systems is causing your staff not to be able to work efficiently. Your billing department cant transfer people through to client care, your sale people cannot transfer people to billling.  No one wants to do a conference call between different department in order to sort out the problem.  Lubabalo Dingani motto : 'The bug stops with me"".. this should be the motto of all your staff, taking in consideration that they have proper systems.  your staff clearly (and I exclude the 2 mentioned here) are more interested in telling a 'irrate' client to stop using foul words after been messed around for more than 6 months, than what they are in sorting out the clients complaint.  Although I was really irate at the time I got through to  Lubabalo Dingani He managed to hear me out, calm me down and reassure me that he is going to sort me out. I did not have to shout, scream, ect, not once was anyting to much to ask. He explained very clearly what I can expect going forward and I hope that at LONG last my account will be sorted out.  Wish telkom would change your systems not fail your staff so miserably.",1,5,11
Great Service at Telkom Cresta from Khan I recently decided to get myself a cellphone contract and went to Telkom and there was a man there named Khan who was so helpful and accomodating. He gave us some tips on how to best look after my new phone as well. I just feel like people dont get nearly enough props out there for doing  a great job. I was very impressed,1,5,18
"Refund I bought a WiFi device @ Telkom shop which cost me R2799
I was told to take the device back to the shop within 7 days is am not happy with the operation of a device 
Yes I found that the device were too expensive to use that to buy 
This device cost me R650 for 3 hours of usage 
On 5th day I decided to take the device back to the shop due to misbehaving of it.
When I get to the shop to return the device they told me to wait  for approval if the device need to be returned or not. 
They took my details and promised to call me with didn’t happen.
I went back to the shop to ask em about a call and approval,they told me I still need to wait.
Then I ask then to keep the divide by them they refused for the second time.out of anger, I decided to leave the device by them and walk out the shop. 
My problem is if it’s 7day rule there’s no question to be asked within the period.
All I know is they should look at a device see if there any harm to it test it and see if Iits in working condition. 
So I feel like they don’t wana pay the money back 

I need your help 
It’s zack silver mc dad others know me as hush 
 I bought this device from Telkom shop in cavendish Claremont Cape Town. 
Thank you.",1,5,1

Great service by Lindokuhle Nkangala I am happy to say that telkom services are one of the best i have experienced on my first day with my telkom contract thanks to Lindokuhle Nkangala who really went out of his way to resolve my issue even if it was a phone setting by me not getting my sms coming through.

Its people like you who makes telkom go forward from good to great. Thank you for all your patients and assistance. I truelly hope management sees the potential in you and gives you the recognition  that you deserve. Kind Regards Peter,1,5,5
"Amazing service from Telkom mobile branch consultant! I was assisted by a consultant named Larna at the Somerset Mall Telkom mobile branch. My previous experiences with dealing with my phone contract (I was at Vodacom for 14 years before) was similar to going to home affairs. I was pleasantly surprised by the service I got, and this is down to Larna. She hooked me up with 2 phones and 2 contracts; quickly and painlessly. She went beyond what she had to do by recommending ways to get my bank statements and a place to eat lunch while I wait. She even allowed to email all my stuff to her instead of printing them as was the case at Vodacom. I kept changing my mind about the color of phone etc and she was super patient.

This consultant alone is the reason why Telkom has a new customer for life. 2 phone contracts I will always renew as long as I have a consultant like her.",1,5,3
"Nangamso Malepe attending to my query like a BOSS After I posted a bad review its also time to get to something GOOD,  I would just really want to give a MASSIVE thanks to Nangamso Malepe from Carnival Mall Branch,

You switched my numbers / upgraded my phones without any hassles , yes load shedding caused some issues however you got me sorted anyway , you are  a real star . Telkom always told me that I cant swich my numbers around with my contract being upgraded and changing which plan goes to which SIM but you !!! you got this done like a BOSS",1,5,8
"Telkom Customer Service Masterclass & Mr Prince ****ens Technician Extraordinaire! I had the most out of world experience today (Saturday). I called Telkom at 9am and they said a fault will need to be logged and a technician assigned. At 10:45am on the same day a technician is waiting outside my house. Mr Prince ****ens, the technician attended to my query over the next 3 hours as he had to drive around and rewire cables on 2 telephone poles. He never quit until he made sure the problem was sorted and fixed another minor issue on my telephone line! A real touch of old school class by this kind gentlemen and I am impressed with Telkom's service, only hope they can consistently be this good. Mr ****ens, thank you Sir.",1,5,3
Devigee Tillay I requested a relocation with Telkom and after a week of no communication and frustration due to their systems being down I phoned again. This time I spoke with an agent by the name of Devigee  Tillay (I hope I spelt your name correctly). She managed to solve my issue within the phone call and a few hours later I was finally contacted by a Telkom technician exactly as Devigee had promised. I therefore wanted to commend her for her service. I hope that all you other frustrated Telkom customers get a chance to be helped by Devigee. My 5star rating is therefore not aimed at Telkom but rather at Devigee.,1,5,1

"PATHETIC SERVICE WITH TELKOM CALL CENTRES The service at telkom is pathetic, my dad lodged a request with them last month to inform them that we need to keep our same lan line number as we will be moving house. Someone called yesterday by the name of Tsholoflo, She said she is from the Sunningdale Call centre. She wanted my dad to confirm his ID, I gave her the ID number like 3 times and she says its incorrect , she asked to speak to my dad, when he gave her the number she still saying incorrect. I asked her what is her designation and she gave me the date. How do you have incompetent people working there. I asked for her manager and she gave me Jessie Kock, but refused to give me her number saying she not allowed. Today at 8:20am i called 10214, spoke to  Alice she saying she from the PE branch. I asked her number for Jessie Kock and she put me on hold for 15 minutes until I cut the call.I need someone with brains to calls me today, I am very upset",1,5,11

"Am I the only lucky one with TELKOM line faults? Just a quick comment, I neglected to get the technician's name - Telkom Ref 66CWK190219), Maitland area, Cape Town.

I have had my TELKOM ADSL line for well over10 years, and since moving to my new premises (approx 8 years) in which time my ADSL line went down three times.
Yesterday was one of them - I started thinking it may be ISP problem, they checked, determined it to be Telkom and logged a fault on my behalf, estimating time for a technician to be available in approx 48 hrs. I do have a data ****le for backup just in case of times like this, and started buying airtime and trying to get my emails up and running again, when 30 minutes later the Telkom technician walked in!!!!
I know Telkom takes a lot of flak or various issues, but the longest I have ever had to wait with all my TELKOM line issues is one hour! 
That is excellent in my book - credit given where credit is due!",1,5,7
thank you Carla for helping me i want to thank a lady by the name of carla for assisting me with the terrible experience from telkom express greenstone shopping center.  the branch did not want to give me a router after signing the contract. my cry for help was heard. this review is purely for Carla. clearly there good people working at telkom.,1,5,27
"Poor service Hello just wanted to say how dissapointed I am with the service I received from from Telkom, ordered a cell phone last week Friday, they even debited my account after these no form of communication on when my device will delivered, decided call and their sales department their IVR kept me waiting for over an hour, I'm dissatisfied with their poor service.",1,5,4
"Billing Query Resolved I had a billiing problem with Telkom for over 6moths. After lodging calls , sending proof of debits and countless communication to get the issue resolved. Nonhlanhla Nkala came to my rescue.  I have never came across such a team leader at Telkom who took so much pride on who work and keeps her promise. She had advised to keep me updated regarding my query and the moment she received feedback she advised me and Donald from back office assist to have the matter resolved. I got reimbursed for the months which i was not able to use my contrat since my account was suspended. Plus the extra amounts added to the invoice were finally credited I made the right amount due and my service was restored . I was ready to port to another network but it’s people like them that encourage us to stay. As a result am currently planning on continuing to get an upgrade with Telkommobile.  Keep the good work Nonhlanhla and Donald. You guys are mega stars in the company ?⭐️??keep on shining ????",1,5,7
"Fantastic Assistance I would like to thank Noluyola Goba in the Telkom Complaints department for going out of her way to assist me this morning - she is such a sweet lady.  A lot of the Telkom Staff can take a leaf out of her book!  She is awesome!

I had this problem for the last 2 weeks after a call centre agent told me to change something that should not have been changed.  Nolu guided me in sorting out the problem that i've been experiencing with my outgoing emails - now i can send and receive emails again. 

THANK YOU NOLU - YOU ARE AN ANGEL!",1,5,74

Excellent Service at Fourways Staff at Telkom Fourways (satisfactorily my service provider for about 3 years)  were so polite & helpful & went the extra mile to sort out a problem seemingly caused by a charge from MTN (my previous non-service provider).  Keep up the good work - you rock☺,1,5,13

"Telkom is the worst telecommunication company in SA Every since Open Serv installed fiber into our complex our telephone line has not worked.  I have logged call after call after call.  The calls keep on being closed without a technician even bothering to come out to attend to the problem  The last time I called I was told that the call had been closed by Altech in JHB.  I find that absolutely astounding as we live in KZN, just reconfirming that technicians are not coming to site.  To make matters worse we are now being billed for another service in Durban.  Again we have logged compliant after complaint with Telkom.  To date nothing has been resolved.  Telkom has to be the worst telecommunication company in South Africa.",1,5,5
"Telkom Good Service Phoned Telkom technical, requested port recreate and reset for slow internet, was done, i lost connection completely. My request was online via the web interface. The work done disconnected me completely, I revisited the online chat site of Telkom and explained my story and Siphamandla Nazo from the service desk resolved my issue with in 10 min what would have taken few days sending engineer, resetting the router and what have you.
Please Telkom, please give Siphamandla Nazo a tap on the back for assisting and for fixing my speed issue as well.
Well done and thank you.

"Excellent Service @SunnyPark and Bad Service @Menlyn I would like to ask Telkom to completely close Menlyn shops.The agents there are useless.Or rather change all of them.Your agents are very rude.I went there several times and the service is the same.Kak.You ask them questions and they dont have answers.Useless.

When i was doin shopping today at Sunny Park.I bumped into a small Telkom Tuck shop.
What surprised me was that the pple at that tuck shop was quite knowledgable and helpful than the guys at Meynlyn Shops.‘n Vrou van Zambië het my gehelp.Ek sal se dit was uitstekende diens.Why do you keep knowledgable pple at a verrander kiosk.So sad.

Agent of the year award goes to Noluthando Dutywa Spoke to Noluthando Dutywa I think from the KZN call centre. Wow I'm blown away by the utmost exceptional service I was given by this lady. When I got to her I had already spoken to 10 agents who weren't patient and friendly at all. Noluthando helped us with our query she even went an extra mile fixed the issues that was created by previous agents then thereafter wanted to make sure that our phone is fully functional.  This lady is an assert and client retainer for Telkom. I honestly salute and honor her passion for her customers. Noluthando you are the best and deserve an agent of the year award.,1,5,3
"Telkom Customer service improving drastically. We tried to cancel our telkom home telephone and ADSL line, we emailed the necessary forms in March 2018 but nothing happened. This week I went onto the live chat function on their homepage. A consultant  replied within seconds. They asked a tedious string of security questions (which I have to admit is needed). After that I was asked to resubmit my cancellation forms. Within the next 2min I received a confirmation that my forms were received and within the hour my phone was dead.

I think they are moving in the right direction with the new customer service head. Never thought I would ever say this but, Good Job Telkom.

"One Bright Star In a Dark Telkom Black Hole Had a call today from a Pieter at Telkom ADSL/Technical Support this morning, and he was the ONLY one which addressed our ADSL synchronisation issue, after 2 weeks of being told that it is our router that was faulty! We went and sourced another router at considerable cost only to have the same sync issues. After throwing my toys out of the cot yesterday 20/12/2018, a Sinhle at 10210 escalated my fault for the technician who previously told us last week that our router was faulty to come out again. Turns out the error was on Telkom's side - Pieter said he did a simple recreate of our profile"" on their server (or something like that) and voila, we're online again! Why can't more people of Pieter's calibre and competence be employed in their call centre?  Now we have purchased an unnecessary second router, and Telkom surely won't be reimbursing us for this!!",1,5,3

"Telkom's Billing /. Complaints department I am just as disgusted with Telkoms service as well.
As I was taking out a contract for +- R605 monthly.  Since end of July my account hasn't been more than R500.00+.

But last month I got an account from July until December, that they haven't charged some things that had to be charged.

She kept telling me what she is doing and how long it will take when putting me on hold. She was just simply the best and very refreshing.

"Nicoleen Shaw, shinning 5 star service To Nicoleen Shaw
You are truly a star that shines bright and worth bragging about.
Not sure where to start, I cancelled my ADSL line on 02/07/2018, the line was cancelled on 03/08/2018, on the 14th August I received an invoice charging R1400 for early cancellations, even though I gave 30 day noticed and the line was cancelled after 30 days.
I called in to query and was informed that it will be reversed, this never happened and I kept on getting the same invoice. I kept on calling, it got escalated about 7 times with no luck, I read on Mybroadband and there was a number to call for these kind of unresolved issues, I called the number and was immediately assisted, Nicoleen Shaw called me back about two hours later, we discussed the situation and, she resolved all outstanding cases on my account, from reversals for down time up until the reversal of the R1400, and now Telkon owes me over R300.
 Aphiwe Gwanya  **********  you are the worse person ever at Telkom, you still working on my case, even after it was resolved by Nicoleen, you should learn from her, or rather leave the company, you are completely useless and bring no value to Telkom.
Nicoleen, you come across as a loving person, mother and wife, you are very caring and most helpful, please keep it up, you make South Africa great, thank you a million for all that you have done, after so many months, it took you less than a day to get everything fixed, I got an sms this morning regarding the payment that is due, all thanks to you, I hope you orginisation, recognise your work and dedication, I wish you all the best, have a wonderful day and all the best of the festive period, thanks a million.
You are my star.

Technical issue I called the customer service line at 21:57 asking why is someone else receiving numerous texts from my number saying SIM Changed. The agent could not tell me why and couldn't assist but instead told me to get the person receiving the texts to call them for further assistance.  I mean it is my number that is sending those texts so why couldn't she check on the system as to why that is happening and stop it?,1,5,5

"You definitely need MORE Staff like Silindile Magwenyane!!! I just have to say that for the first time in many years being at a Telkom Store was such a pleasure. I was at the Telkom La Lucia Branch earlier today to upgrade my Contract. I was assisted by SILINDILE MAGWENYANE, who was SO friendly and had a smile on her face the whole time while attending to us unlike most of the Telkom staff that make you feel you are a burden for walking into their store.
She’s very enthusiastic about her job and it showed in the manner in which she answered all of our questions and treated us. She is certainly  fun, friendly and innovative,  hard working and dedicated. Her sterling work ethic is exemplary and sets a standard for others to follow. Silindile Magwenyane's    attitude and Zest for her job is rare to find !!!!  So Telkom please take good care of this lady ...she is definitely  taking good care of you!!! :)",1,5,26

By 9.30 all was done and dusted and functioning perfectly.  They were courteous, efficient and knew what they were doing.  Thank you Jonathan!

"Phumulani Mashinini asset to telkom Good day

I just made a call to your call center regarding my billing dispute and spoke to Phumulani Mashinini. I would like to compliment him for an excellent service rendered by him. I had an issue with my billing statement as i was charged for a bounce debit order. Telkom attempted to deducted funds before my debit order date  and charged R202 .70 for a rejected debit plus the installment for August 2018 and September 2018 however they collected the installment for August 2018 after my pay day.  It has been confirm by the agent that i will be reimbursed the fee should the deduction take place or the normal installment will be deducted this month which i am happy about it.

I would like to thank Phumulani for going an extra mile to assist me and the team leader whom i didn't get the name. I was ready to settle this account and close it, just after three months having the contract already i am experiencing bad service which was the reason i cancelled my MTN contract because they charge you fees for their own mistake of not submitting a debit. Phumulani prove to be the deciding factor and a guy with his qualities is certainly an asset to the company.

Thank you Phumulani Mashinini",1,5,1

"Lack of customer care from Telkom I have been dealing with suppose to be a supervisor her name is Gugu Mashome for a couple of months now trying to sort our my Directors Telkom mobile account.  Last year December 2017 my boss renewed his cell phone contract. Since last year he thinks his been using his new contract package not noticing that Telkom was billing him for his new contract as well as his old contract. We only noticed in July that this was the case.
Ever since then we have been sending emails to Gugu, who is just not sorting out the problem or giving us our refund, until today every month they still debiting from our company bank account. Gugu sent us to buy a new sim card, but nothing so far has been done to keep my Director happy. I am his PA and he has been asking me everyday why Telkom has not gotten back to me yet or sorted out this problem. Their lack of customer service is really ridiculous. My boss now wants to take legal action and to change networks as they keep on deducting for the new contract as well as the old contract and nothing is being done to correct this problem.",1,5,7
"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE My 24th month contract date was coming up and I called Telkom to cancel as I did not want to be on a month to month. Upon contacting Telkom, I was disappointed to hear that a customer needs to go online to cancel. Anyways, that didn't work out. I took the liberty of contacting the call center where I was assisted and was asked to send through the screenshot of the error online.
The consultant by the name of Muntu Howard Sogobile assisted me. After I sent through the emails he PROMISED to contact me back as he needed to escalate my cancellation. 2 days before the end date, I contacted Telkom again but could not get through to Muntu. Not knowing that he was doing everything in his power to ensure that my contract/request went through. 

I am delighted as he even took the liberty to call me and advise that the contract has now been cancelled. Such GOOD CUSTOMER service is what Telkom needs to move forward, dedicated stuff who go the extra mile to ensure that customers are happy. Thank you Muntu Howard Sogobile for all that you have done. I hope TELKOM knows that they have an amazing employee in you. Keep up the good work for others in the future.",1,5,27
"Telkom ripping there clients Good day. 

Hope all is well. 

I spoke to lovely lady Nontobeko Ngubani and I was advised that I will be charged amount of R 202.70 for unpaid debit order.

Firstly my payment arrangement with Telkom is for the 25th of each month and Telkom decided to debit a day early on the 24th which now has incurred extra fees on the my bank account and on my contract. On the 28th Telkom debit the full outstanding amount on my contract which means my contract is up to date but I'm still being charged a fee which in my mind is unacceptable because this is not my problem it is Telkom problem for debiting on the wrong date. 

I never experienced this before. 

All the dates I received a salary on a Saturday. 
June 2016
February 2017
March 2017
November 2017.

Further more I spoke to Sibusisiwe Nyuswa from and she told that on my statement it indicates that I'll be debited on the 24th after checking my statement the 24th does not appear on my statement but a due date does which is the 31st of the month.",1,5,7
"Exceptional Remedial Action By Telkom Agent Alistor Ramsam/Ramsamy *********** I am a loyal customer of Telkom SA  and because of that morale fibre that exists even took business to the company I have a senior role in.

I have recently moved house and relocated from the out building to the main ,On the 03rd September 2018 I logged my first call for assistance to have the line moved at the same location,First the agent captured details incorrectly and the call was closed without being attended too.

I spoke to a lady by the name of Angel who was equally awesome in trying to remedy this bit because of network and disconnection in call (dropped call) she could not complete my request.

I later decided to call back and a gentle man by the name of Alistor Ramsam/Ramsamy (e-mail:  **********  assisted after he had to bare the brunt of being at the receiving end of dissatisfaction especially because I have been told that systems are down a number of times trying to interact.

Alistor who needs to be applauded for his s**** to manage conflict especially with clients and furthermore pacify situation that ability for me is recomendable.Not only that but through offering me and availing the possibility of interacting using e-mail as primary communication proved his determination to attend to my query in full.Alistor is amongst the many I believe who will change the service level at Telkom.

My query has been resolved and technician dispatched to attend to it thanks to Alistor as sms texts confirms for Friday,14th September 2018.Alistor needs to share his s**** and qualities with some of his team members ,Although basic and common practise requirements he remains amongst the little who doesn't mind applying himself to the betterment of service delivery.

Telkom Billing,
 
I am sending this email on behalf of my mother.
 
I find it very disturbing that Telkom can treat an elderly customer the way, she has been treated. She visited Telkom Stores, communicated several times via telephone and sms conversations to address her problem and get reimbursed of a Total Amount of R15,500.00, that Telkom still continues to deduct monthly from her bank account(R750).
 
Now, AGAIN she has been requested to provide proof of payments that she has sent several times before. I am now urgently request that this matter get resolved, before I am going too revert to legal action, escalation to Telkom’s Leadership and Social Media. This is not a threat, but a promise.

"Excellent service from Telkom I cancelled my Telkom Line services online last week via the Telkom website.

 I got a call from Dennayel today regarding my cancellation and he processed my account professionally. 

I have also read about some complaints regarding cancellations in the media, but my experience today is the opposite. 

I also would like to express my gratitude for excellent service from Telkom over the past  35 years.

During my career I had the privilege to deal with Telkom on many levels regarding Voice, Data, VSAT, ADSL, Landlines as well as the ISDN infrastructure.

Whether it was a member from management or a junior staff member, I was always treated with courtesy and respect.
On many occasions a Telkom staff member put in extra effort to assist, and that is greatly appreciated.  

Over the years I also had issues regarding faults that sometimes took longer to repair than expected, but that was the exception, not the rule.

You never know what the future holds, and if my circumstances change in the future I will apply for a new Telkom service again.",1,5,3

The installation team (Mandla and Thabo)  and civil team (led by Kingston) were at my place to for an installation recently. All of them were extremely professional, and did not treat the job like a job to finish and just move on. They treated it with an attitude of ""how can we best serve today"", it was amazing. 
They took every care to leave my place the same way they found it, or even better. 

Management at Telkom, Please find this team, and recognise them?

I was able to go onto the internet and you tube this Woman's day and my day became exciting as I encountered stories that related to me and my situation as well as ways to move on. I was really motivated by these stories and was streghthened from them.
I cannot Thank you enough. Your free data came at the right time and made my Woman's day pleasurable. I sincerely Thank you. My life is definately changed for the better going forward.",1,5,12

Exceptional Service. Nomusa Gcabashe is the Consultant who initially assisted in the porting of my existing mobile number to Telkom.  She advised me on the process of the application. She also went the extra mile by creating the account by contacting me electronically on my email.  More of this type of pleasant attitude is required in the service industry.  Keep up the good work.,1,5,1
"Rhulani Constance MUST be acknowledged for her s****s. Good day Telkom / Rhulani Constance,

I would like to thank Rhulani Constance for all her help during this difficult time.
She is the only one who actually really helped me, got back to me and didn't leave me to just suffer in silence.
Due to her Telkom was saved another 100 emails AND saved you a client.

This lady should be given a raise and her s****s acknowledged especially at a company like Telkom.
She KNOWS how to make her clients feel better and is very pleasant to speak to, friendly yet so professional.
Again thank you Constance. I really from the bottom of my heart appreciate all you have done and will give praise whenever I can.

From now if I ever do encounter any problems I will skip everyone and come straight to you with an assured feeling that I will be ok.

Thank you!!!
I hope you have a lovely day!!
Many Blessings!",1,5,12

"Telkom Disservice I have been using Telkom services since 2012 to procure data monthly for Internet services with my desk top computer at home. I started with their Simple Option, then migrated to the 5GB + 5GB for R 199 per month.
Sometime last year, Telkom advertised  a package of 10GB +10GB for the same R199. About July 2017,  Telkom called me to say that they could deliver to me a new router HUAWEI B315-8F9F, which they were promoting  for no extra charge and I obliged. Days later they delivered the router as promised.

On 17 August I went to Telkom Office in Hatfield Pretoria to migrate from the 5GB + 5GB to 10GB + 10GB for the same R199 as they advertised.  Unknown to me, the girl at the shop opened a separate account on the  10GB + 10GB and was delivering another set of the same HUAWEI router to me. I told her I already had the router and the girl said I could sell the previous one, as it was then selling for about R1, 400. I was taken aback as I wondered how I could stand by street corner to sell a Telkom router. It was not until November 2017 that I discovered that I was unknowingly running two accounts and Telkom was now charging me double the amount R398 instead of R199, and later increased the charge to R406 per month.  Towards the end of November 2017 I went to the same Telkom shop in Hatfield to ask them to council one of the  accounts since I only had one computer. I reiterated that I wanted Telkom to migrate me from 5GB + 5GB to 10GB + 10GB for the same R199, which is what I had asked for on 17 August 2017.

Since then Telkom has been debiting my account with all sorts of suprelious charges R706,  R1000+ etc. I have lodged over six  complaints for this migration to be effected, but Telkom will not act on my request. Insead, it continued to debit my account.  In March or so this year, I was advised by my bank to reverse the charges, which I did and from then Telkom suspended my account but continued to charge my account and will not honour my continued request to have one of the accounts cancelled and migrate me to the 10GB + 10GB till today. As I write, Telkom has since suspended my account but continues to charge geometrically increasing amounts against my account. Please help save me from Telkom's financial stress, which has lingered for about one year now.",1,5,9
"Awesome service I had with Telkom Would like to extend my gratitude to Lefentse Monyela and Launa Molapo forthe outstanding service i received from them.

"Telkom Direct N1 City This 5 Star rating I am giving because of one individual at Telkom Direct N1 City. I would like to thank Anele for her service and her willingness to help. She is friendly, informative and very good at her job. Other employees took their time, walked around, had chats with each other while Anele was helping 2 clients at a time without wasting any time. While busy with clients she also assisted her colleagues with questions they had. Telkom please look after this lady because I think she has the potential to go far in your company.

Thank you very much Anele!",1,5,1

Telkom Shop at Cornubia mall
I would like to compliment one of your staff member’s for the service I received from her.

I walked in with a couple of question that I needed help with regarding one of my Telkom contracts.

On her own she was able to answer all of my questions ( As an I.T professional I was impressed)  
After she answered all my questions I was able to make a decision and she was able to assist me with the way forward

"Backup power keeping the network going while we sit in the dark So often people focus on the negatives.  However, I have noticed that during the current prolonged power outage in Pretoria East, that many of the cellphone towers have additional, portable backup power generation in place.  This would be in addition to the batteries that would be on site for the relatively short term power outages.  Clearly a disaster recovery plan is in place and has been executed before the network falls over in the affected areas.  I am not sure which of the networks has provided this backup plan, but it appears that the networks are working together to solve this potential problem before the masses have yet another reason to complain.  Well done Mobile Networks and thanks for keeping us connected while we sit in the dark!",1,5,22
"Thank you to Dewalt Conradie at Telkom Direct, Tygervalley Hi,

I went to get a new phone at Telkom Direct in Tygervalley Centre, since that morning I had lost my phone and had no backup or extra SIM etc., etc.. Now it was particularly important for me to have my phone at all times as my mom was in hospital and it was unclear whether she would make it - any mintue situation. I needed a phone and quick. 

The sales agent who helped me in store, Dewalt Conradie, was incredible. He was clear, helped me decide on a phone, explained all the odds and ends and within an hour I had everything and was on my phone again, sorted out. This guy seriously saved my life. I was amazed and will be forever grateful.

I was meant to get a review SMS (rating the service etc.) but I didn't. So I am on here to say the rating would have been a 12/10.  So I am on here hoping he will get this somehow. I plan to contact him on Facebook too.

If anyone needs anything from Telkom, get hold of this guy from Telkom Direct in Tygervalley.  Dewalt Conradie, we need more of these guys in these positions. What a pleasure.

Thank you!",1,5,18
"Wrong device,contract,names and Forever offline Dear Telkom

I am so disappointed in the kind of service you offer. On the 26th of June I did a online application with one of your sales agent.

"Very disappointed in Telkom On 22 March 2018 I send t a request to Telkom to change my account from my personal name to my Business name.  After two months  I did not receive any reply from them. I tried to enquire a few times but nobody could give a straight answer.  The one lady suggested I should  send a email to a  Mr Govender  **********  witch is the manager at the business department.   Up to date there has been no reply from him.   On the 8th of May I enquired again and spoke to Desisha Gounded.  In the beginning she was very helpful and promised to follow it up.  At the same time I requested to take out a contract for a new laptop  they advertised .  She send me a application form witch I completed with all the relevant documents.  I followed up with her about a week later and she said they are busy to process everything and will come back to me.  Since then she did not replied again on any of my follow up emails.  I really think as a Telkom client for 15 years plus i deserve a little better service.  I am so disappointed.  I need to get my account in order for my Tax retur, as i am not able to deduct my Telkom account from my Business.  This is costing me money and I dont thing it is fair.",1,5,3
"Telkom Cresta Service Personnel helped so nice!! Thank you! The lady this morning at the Services side (far right [+/- 10h30], I did not get her name), but thank you for your valuable assistance and helping me with all my inquiries.

She had such patience with me as I did not follow a few things too well and there we go! A wonderful weekend ahead from a friendly service person.

I know I want to almost burn places down out of frustrations with the way things are handled most of the time, but today was lovely. Thanks again.",1,5,56
"Telkom service excellence! We were very excited when Fibre was eventually activated in our area, and we immediately applied to be linked.
Yesterday we discovered that the link was off and that we did not have access to the Internet. Typically of our Country’s people, the first response when I mentioned the fact that I experienced issues with the link towards two colleagues, was “typically Telkom”, and “why did you use them”?

I am a very satisfied and proud Telkom customer tonight, and believe me that I will convey the message to the pessimists that I spoke to yesterday morning!
Your Telkom Fibre Help number was very helpful, and when the lady identified the problem I was assured that a Technician would call me, regarding the configuration of the router. Now for the next surprise, when Altaf Essop called me!
This man’s service is absolutely excellent and he is the Master of patience.
Altaf assisted me with the process and not once, I felt uncomfortable or got the impression that I am wasting his time.  
One tends to feel embarrassed, especially when Technical terms are used, but not with Altaf on the other end of the line!

Well done Telkom, and specifically Altaf. You guys have walked the extra mile and the fact that I was back on line, the same afternoon after my report, clearly illustrates commitment and dedication towards Telkom customers.
You have a gem in the form of Altaf, and yes, this is typically the kind of person that I would appreciate assisting my Senior citizen parents, and  the man on the street when, for the first time having access to this absolutely fantastic technology, and communication platform of the future.

Well done Telkom, and thank you for the amazing service!",1,5,3

Best Service Ever I sent my phone for repairs to telkom and I expected to get bad service as usual but this time was surprisingly different.

"Excellent Customer Service Good Day
I would hereby like to compliment one of your employees, Clint September at your Adderley Street branch, for the excellent service he provided . Clint helped me to sort out my account that I have been trying to cancel since December at various other outlets , in order for me to do an upgrade I needed to cancel the existing contract.
I am pleased with the service I received at your branch. Clint’s professionalism and enthusiasm to get to the root of the issue promptly exceeded my expectations. Your colleague resolved the issue in my benefit by following up and finding alternatives before resolution of my query.
This type of professionalism and commitment to the highest level of customer’s satisfaction has to be acknowledged. 
Having in mind such a pleasant experience with your colleague it would be my pleasure to continue doing business with your company in the future.",1,5,2
"'n Pluimpie vir TELKOM. I live in KZN and have had my fair share of complaints about customer services in general. So, when I receive fair to good service I feel that it is necessary to pass on a compliment to help build confidence in the individuals that have done well. I have been a customer of Telkom since the late 70's, using a landline. Then in 2010 I got an ADSL connection. Apart from normal outages, not one lasted more than 3 days, I felt fortunate to have a good service provider. Due to circumstances I had to cut back on expenses, and the landline/ADSL was one area that I targeted. I researched the offers from mobile service providers and over a period of 3 months managed to get new phone on contract and  a mobile WIFI router for my PC, saving  more than R300 every month. I then cancelled my landline & ADSL on  the 15th of the month, and 30 days later got my final account, which I settled and had no problems with Telkom regarding that account. So to the unfortunate customers out there I wish you good luck and hope you get your problems sorted. A final tip: Do all your requests/ instructions/ complaints via e-mail, send those to as many consultants/ department managers/ the office of the CEO, don't just refer to one individual.",1,5,4
"Thank you Telkom I had telkom install fibre a while ago.  I have had nothing but great service from them.
I have always recommended them to people.  The branch at stadium on main in Claremont is especially helpful.  They go the extra mile.
Imagine my surprise when I got a human phoning me for my birthday.  She sent me an email.
I could choose a birthday present from a list of items. 
I was shocked.  I did not have to spend a certain amount of money to get a discount or a discount voucher for my birthday.  I could actually choose a present without having to do anything but choose.  I chose a kettle for my son who has moved to his own flat.
It arrived a few days later with a lovely birthday card inside.
Thank you Telkom",1,5,7
"Telkom impresses where vodacom fails from beginning to end After a horrific experience at cellucity/vodacom call center I would like to commend TELKOM direct store in Walmer park Port Elizabeth for their assistance and help with new contracts and knowledge of all deals..all staff were friendly and actually calmed me down after vodacom decided to ruin my day.... Keep up the service and your customer centric approach .. .. vodacom and cellucity had a different approach : Funny how vodacom is the only company with automated responses... well done to telkom, cell c and mtn for personalising responses with a proper and effective solution... vodacom should maybe take a few pointers from them... thank you to telkom for assisting with brilliant deals on new contracts and for the great customer orientated experience unlike vodacom with management level consultant sinetemba ""I don't care the situation you find yourself in and I will drop the call if you continue telling me about your situation...

I have not been able to receive calls on my primary and only daily used number for 48 hours already but can commend them with a invoice to cancel my contract - apparently they communicate when it comes to them receiving money very swiftly and with no apology ... this amounts to R3850 for q contract that has 4 months left .. #vodacomsucks#vodacomdoesnotvaluecustomers",1,5,8

"The previous one I am very dissapointed in telkom's mobile service provider 8ta mobile..Their service is poor and dispicable.I have been going to Menlyn since may just for a sim swop.Don't get me wrong some of the guys there know what they are doing but other's it's either you wonder if the person does not understand the business language or the global communication language call English.
I blaclisted my numberon the  02 may 2018 itc number  ********** 3
imei number for my p10 lite huawei phone was  **********  ********** 5
I even went to the police station to get a case number
When tried getting a sim swop I was told differnt stories from the wrong sim was activated
A complaint was logged with telkom via the calldesk.I was given a simcard when I got home it was not active.I called the call desk and they said a complaint was logged.I went to 8ta mobile menlyn again and they said I must wait a week my sim card will be active I waited a week call the call desk and they said I must go to the store.I went to the store .The same process a cI complaint was logged.I have to  case number's  ********** 3. nothing was done with that complaint .I was give a sim.Last week thurday I went to 8ta mobile hatfield and was told the wrong sim was activated cause the one they gave me  was not the one activated on the system.I had my id and not my proof of res so this sUNDAY i WENT SAYING I GOT AND SMS SAYING MY CASE NUMBER  ********** 6 was reolved i called the call desk and they said I must got to the store and my sim will be activated.I went there to menlyn again and the lady wanted to lodge a complaint again I told and showed the sms that why does she wanna lodge a complaint I gave her the calldesk and they said she must activate my sim and she was not supposed to lodge a complaint.The last lady who helped maybe did not understand but atleast tried nad gave me a sim card and said by monday it will be working still today my sim card is in active.The previous one was just starnge and it was likje she did not understand what was happening.
nOW MY OTHER DISSAPOINTMENT is when I fetched the p10 lite  I asked for insurance  and the klady said 8ta mobile does not give insurance and just left.When I got home I also did not find  the pin that comes with the phone
and on the previous upgrade before that I also asked for insurance and was also asked if they had insurance and was told no.Now Iam paying for a contarct phone  was told the was no insurance now since may my sim card is not activated.
Truelly speaking I do not know who hires at telkom mobile butI am dissapointed
Someone who works for a mobile company must be presentable must most impotantly understand english and must understand the mobile industry
And menlyn or pretoria is one of the key busineess hubs in gauteng
Now I am buying airtime and data because of incompentence.I am really dissapointed
I should have just stcuk with Mtn or Vodacom not a mickey mouse mobile company like telkom mobile and it used to be state owned they really must clean up their act or just go back to the landline service and be sold back to the state.They are just not proffessional enough
I am really dissapointed.",1,5,1
"Successful port from Gugu at Eastgate. I wanted to port from Vodacom to Telkom.
I went to Telkom the first time and everything was done for me took less than 5 mins. I was helped by GUGU Eastgate express shop.

However after my Vodacom simcard lost network and didnt want to change network to telkom (Vodacom's antics to frustrate people from Porting).  I then Went to Telkom two days later to explain my dilemma and Gugu helped me again and did a new port  with a new simcard cause it looked like vodacom was playing tricks again.

48 hours later My Vodacom sim lost network and was having issues again in completing the port, i went to the Telkom the 3rd  time and this time i left the shop with my port completed and bought new Telkom data!! 

Vodacom makes it so difficult to leave their network, if Gugu from Telkom Easgate express wasnt on hand to assist at all 3 instances when i made a trip to the Telkom shop i would never have ported successfully.  Thank you so much to Telkom and Gugu at Eastgate.",1,5,8

They reprocessed the order and fixed the data issue all within 2 hours. Thanks for the great service.",1,5,7
"Telkomical I am giving Telkom 5 stars because maybe if they somehow detect a compliment on the internet, their systems might overload and crash from the shock of actually receiving a compliment anywhere.

I submitted a request to Telkom to cancel my router contract which actually expired last year and is still continuing because obviously Telkom just love stealing money from under peoples noses.

Now I have to jump through hoops, do cartwheels, ****** a leprechaun and drink snake venom just to get it cancelled and even then they will still keep charging me because, hey, who cares about cancellations when you can steal peoples money?

I am sick of all these corrupt South African businesses that are predicated on innumerable clauses, terms and conditions which are intricately designed to trap the unsuspecting citizen into the most heinous and soul destroying circumstances imaginable.

From Telkom with its subversively innocuous money pilfering tactics to insurance companies that fleece innocent people with their convenient loopholes and narcissistic disdain for other human beings, to the innumerable other artfully designed fronts which camouflage criminalistic and autocratic organisations.

We as the tax paying, law abiding and evident minority need to do something about this. But the question is, what?",1,5,23

Then last week Friday I call in YET again and a lady by the name of Latoya helps me, she is patient as I tell her my long winded story and helps me through the steps.... guess what??? A problem that has taken me almost a year to sort out, Latoya did so for me in a matter of minutes, 3 days later, everything is working as I requested....

He explained the problem and advised me that he was following it up with his superiors. Well done Great Job....",1,5,39
"Lost hope I upgraded my landline with adsl in Nov 2017..... Till date my upgrade has not been completed.... I have still not received delivery.... I have made endless calls and most of the time it's just a waste..... I'm tired..... I wish I could cancel everything..... That's not the end..... To top it off telkom puts me on the wrong package..... I try to correct this..... One they are either or always offline, two the bills department says phone sales, the sales department says phone bills and then eventually when you get somewhere with no hope they are always offline...... I'm paying for something I don't have.... I don't know what to do anymore.... And finally now my landline is down.... Logged a fault but as usual..... 
Tired and frustrated ?......

What's the point of going to the store a million times when they don't help as well..... Always offline!",1,5,1
"Telkom LTE no assistance and steal my money I have tried many times to get telkom out to my house to sort out my LTE internet I have called and logged the case with them last week Friday with no joy,now I get a sms from them telling me it's been resolved but I have not even heard from a tech nor Telkom themselves and my internet is still not working so my question now is how is it been resolved when no one has been to my home and has not contacted me and next how will they credit me with having no internet access since I first logged the call,I am very upset and would rather look for another service provider than Telkom.
My account has been debited from Telkom they are quick to take money from people bt are never quick to help as far as I know they are now stealing money from me",1,5,1
"Telkom agents incababilities On the 20th I went to Telkom at the Greenstone mall and I was ""assisted"" by an agent called Esther 
Mosakae. I requested she explain to me about the Huawei P smart contract deals. She indicated to me that the FreeMe 1gig  topup option included 100 minutes to other networks,  3000 minutes to Telkom numbers and other landlines,  50 sms a day, free WhatsApp, mms messages. So I took up that FreeMe 1gig topup option as I felt I had the correct information. The deal also comes with 30g for 3 months.
On Saturday,  the 21st I tried making a call to an MTN number but I was informed that I don't have airtime to make a call. I tried installing other applications on the phone but I couldn't because the data I was.told I'd get had been depleted. 
On Tuesday the 23rd I called the same store requesting to speak to Esther as she was the one compiling the deal, I was told she's off duty. I had called the telkom call centre to ask about the contents of the deal I had signed up for. I was told that my deal.doesn't have 100 minutes to other networks as informed by Esther. So in the absence of Esther the telkom Express manager of Greenstone mall said that there was nothing they could do as they'd need to speak to Esther first so she could relate her side of the story. I was informed she'd be back on the 25th April and they'd give me a call after they've spoken to her.
I waited until today,  the 26th April and there was still no response from them. I called the store again and fortunately got hold of Esther.  According to Esther, she doesn't remember the details of the information she provided me. I said to her I had a witness.on the day and I'm willing to bring the witness as I want this 100 minutes component of the deal as was advertised to me.on the 20th April 2018. She said she first needs to consult her superiors and then she'll give me a ring, this was at 11:45 am, 26th April. It's now 22:22 Thursday,  26th April and I still didn't get a call from that liar. I called the call centre again to enquire about the network service as I was could not have access to the Internet. I was informed that my data was depleted. I'm still shocked that 10gig of data can be depleted in one day. The consultant informed me.that the 10gig wasn't loaded and she will make.a request for it to be loaded. So basically I'm getting a deal that I cannot cancel even when I'm getting a third of what was advertised to me.",1,5,1

"Excellent Service!!! #greatbusiness Two weeks ago, we decided to go to the Telkom offices at Midlands Mall in Pietermaritzburg. Being unsure as to which package to sign up for, we were advised about the different products by a consultant by the name of Simi Mbhele. This chap was more than just helpful, he even offered me his chair as I was battling to stand for long... yet he himself stood on his feet for the remainder of the consultation! Boy did he KNOW his stuff! He was extremely knowledgeable in advising us about the different products available, and gave us excellent advice! The whole time we were there, he treated us in a professional, friendly, respectful manner. He’s an absolute ASSET to Telkom! How I wish other businesses could render such superb service to their customers...! Thank you for such EXCELLENT SERVICE, Simi!",1,5,3

"TELKOM WIFI - FOURWAYS CROSSING - EXCELLENT SERVICE PROVIDER!!! Dear All,

I wish to advise ANYONE wanting EXCELLENT SERVICE,  and seeks a good understanding of LTE 4G WIFI networks to go to the TELKOM FOURWAYS CROSSING BRANCH.

There customer service is excellent.  They are so dedicated in assisting their customers and make it their business to investigate any problems that may occur perhaps on your account or even on your hardware... AND THEY FIX IT!!!!

I took out a contract with them in December and I CANNOT FIND ANOTHER ISP SUPPLIER THAT CAN BEAT THEIR PRICES AND SERVICE.

EVEN the Fibre that is going in all over the show - IT IS SO EXPENSIVE.  But these people knew my budget, my network requirement needs and provided me with the perfect solution.

I just want to say THANK YOU!

Great job",1,5,20
"Telkom not cancelling line despite numerous requests Hello

We cancelled a Telkom line on the 3rd of July 2017.

"Zoduma... a call centre agent with a massive amount of integrity... I spoke to Zoduma Gontshi on the 19th of April regarding issues with the delivery of my parcel. I had no tracking number and I  could not get through to the department that deals with the tracking of orders. Instead of just sending me on to another department like call centre agents usually do or giving me a number to call, Zoduma gave me very professional service which indicated that she had every intention of delivering the best possible service to me as a customer. She could so easily just have passed me on to another call centre or call centre agent but instead she provided me with full details of the parcel including waybill number. She was friendly and helpful throughout our conversation and very professional. This type of service is rare and deserves to be acknowledged. Zoduma you're a star!!! I hope your integrity takes you far on a professional front.",1,5,44
A Surprise from Telkom It was very refreshing to call Telkom for help with an issue when the Agent was knowledgeable and friendly. She assisted me and got me up and running.

"TELKOM JUST SIMPLY THE BEST David Tshabalala really gave me excellent service and he is also very helpful and kind and patient which are all qualities which are very essential for a call centre agent.  I realize that most agents are always under presure and most often have to endure tremendous verbal abuse and for that reason I commend David.  I must also add that this kind of service is very prevalent from Telkom call centres and seems to be lacking at other Mobile Service Providers such as Vodacom , MTM and Cell C.  Telkom is just the BEST!!!",1,5,7
"Raymond for president I must say the only reason I'm giving Telkom a 5 star is coz of your technician named Raymond in Richards bay, what an absolute champ, such a nice guy and actually cares about client satisfaction and goes out his way to help.. I hope you treat him well and if all your employees were as efficient as him Telkom would be a dream",1,5,13
"Fantastic Service from Telkom I cancelled my Telkom ADSL as i moved to Fibre and as my final payment, i mistakenly overpaid by a substantial amount.  I contacted the Call Centre to enquire about the process of a refund.  The Call Centre Agent was extremely sympathetic to my dilemma.  She asked if she could put me on hold while she found out the best possible way for her to refund me my money.  When she came back, she told me she would process my request and a refund would take approximately 72 working hours.  Due to it being over the Easter Weekend, it ended up taking a week but all my money was refunded back into my account.  I really thought getting my money back was going to be an uphill battle but Telkom were really accommodating and extremely efficient - Thank you so much to  Nokuthula",1,5,3

"Excellent service by Mr. Wilson Mawas at Pavilion I recently moved over to Telkom Mobile and had endless issues with having my old number ported to Telkom. The call center was of no use, and I spent hours waiting to speak to a consultant on several occasions, only to be told that the issue is being escalated, but with no results. I even tried chatting to an agent, and emailing Telkom several times, but still the issue was not resolved. Furthermore, no one had the decency to keep me informed regarding the status of the port. Finally, I went to the Pavilion branch, and dealt with Mr. Wilson Mawas. He was extremely helpful, took down my details and contacted me several times until the port was affected.  At a time when I was extremely frustrated with Telkom, and their service this gentleman proved that Telkom has got people who respect ad care about their customerS.  A major thumbs up to Wilson, and keep up the good work.",1,5,1
"Thank You Telkom (Sumaya and ***wa) I'd like to thank two ladies who work in different divisions at Telkom for assisting me throughout with my smart virtual office line. 

Sumaya Saidally and ***wa Abdurahman. I can tell you that they assisted me selflessly and remained calm throughout the process. I know this because I'm not the easiest of customers to work with. They don't even know that I'm sending a compliment as for me this is too far and far between for Telkom.   THANK YOU LADIES.  KEEP ON ACHIEVING THE BEST FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS THUS BUILDING YOUR BRAND.

"Surprised and happy to see improvement. So I had Issues with my line, this was due to two things. One was that they messed up my order when i moved my line and the other was some rusty connector. I managed to get it solved within 5 days. I know this still seems like a lot but compared to dealing with them a year ago they have improved dramatically. I would suggest contacting them on twitter then using chat function on site and then only calling. Also it seems like the tech department is the guys you wanna talk to.",1,5,2
"Well done Telkom I had such an excellent experience at Telkom N1 City.
I was at first a little worried as it seemed so busy with little staff. But they had chairs to sit on while waiting!
I was then served by Gerry McBurgh who was so positive despite seeing the amount of people waiting. He was smiling and friendly and was happy to hold a small conversation while their systems were slow.   I was extremely happy and just wanted to mention his name!

Thanks so much for making what seemed to be something stressful so easy!",1,5,12

"Great service from Lelo at Telkom Direct at The Glen Shopping Centre I was at the Telkom Direct store at The Glen Shopping Centre in Johannesburg South on Tuesday 13 March at about 15h30. Sadly, the place has no chairs and there were very long lines. There are always long lines at that Telkom and it is such a pity because the people who work there are so pleasant.

Anyway, after receiving alot of terrible treatment from the people standing in the lines, a service agent by the name of Nompumelelo Ndlovu (Lelo) gave us some amazing and friendly service. She was patient and helpful and she did not allow the fact that she was dealing with many frustrated people get to her. She was a real pleasure and I hope people like her get the fair treatment from the public that they deserve.",1,5,2

"Telkom I recently relocated to a rural part of Mpumalanga from Sandton, Johannesburg. Part of this transition was to transfer my Telkom landline phone and ADSL to  my new address.  I initially thought that I would battle to no end to get this transfer completed but I am very happy to say that Telkom at Riverside Mall in Nelspruit (Nthabiseng in particular) has been nothing but wonderful in helping me stay connected in an area where there are no Telkom lines and very little connectivity. Unfortunately I was still being billed for an account which I had cancelled but, after a few quick phone calls, Telkom has credited my account and proceeded with the cancellation (thank you to Melissa at the call centre). I have since migrated mine and my daughter's cell phone contracts to Telkom as well, as they have proven that they are serious about client satisfaction.

TELKOM - Super excellent service Give credit where it is due!  Telkom I have been a client for many years and have sometimes felt like I just did not want to do business with you anymore!

"telkom / sell direct This review mostly applies to Sell Direct Marketing however, it does not seem that you can get a hold of them and because they phone telling you they are calling on behalf of Telkom I think that Telkom seriously needs to address this issue. Just googling sell direct brings up hundreds of complaints from unhappy customers for this selling agent. Surely you people should by now realize there is a problem here. I logged a complaint case  ********** 4 with telkom only to be told when i called again that it was closed because its not their problem its sell direct that has to deal with it. I wasnt notified it was closed or given any feedback, it was simply closed and found this out when I called telkom again. But then when you try to reach sell direct, nothing. really? What are we supposed to do then?

I have numerous deals through Telkom and Sell Direct. The sales person who calls you is so quick to promote items and throw it your way, giving you false information, selling you products that is not worth half of what they say to you on the phone. The marketing agents are a bunch of liars, scheming people out of their hard earned money, binding them to that contract for 2 years. 

Their call centre is a fake line that does not even work. Email addresses either don't work or don't get responded too. I question whether there is, in fact, a call center in existence at all and how they are even able to operate legally. 
I have never ever had such bad service in my entire life. The fact that Telkom actually deals with them as their selling agent is pathetic. You cannot even give us proper details on how to get a hold of them. How is that even possible?
No amount of raising complaints makes any difference what's so ever. And like all my other queries, this one will probably get no where as well. 

I would just like to point out that once my contracts come to end, I will NEVER be renewing with Telkom or Sell Direct. My cell phone, husbands cell phone and home internet will be done through a completely different agent! As it seems that, this is all the power we as consumers have as we cant do anything while bound to a contract with you people.

After logging a sales query for uncapped ADSL, I get a phone call from a gentleman telling me that having 100 gigs day and 100 gigs night time data will be over enough for streaming, gaming and running my entertainment centre. And that after 100 gigs there are, in any case, consumer usage policies that slow the internet down so uncapped is not worth my while. Well, my ignorance on the subject was clearly musing to this gentleman, as I fell for it and then realized what rubbish this actually was. Tell me, is preying on technology ignorant people how you make sales? Getting them trapped and then having no follow up method or escalation process? I fail to understand how human beings can operate like this. They stooped me into deal costing R749 per month for 100 gigs day and 100 gigs night, where there was a adsl uncapped deal for R899, why wasnt I given this option when this was what I requested in the first place! and got told its not worth it!

I hope by posting here, if I get no response, atleast I can help a fellow customer from getting trapped like I was.",1,5,4

Data bundles My name is Jimmy Kirk and am so happy with the Telkom data bundle which i use for my forex trading and  bitcoin mining. I used to use Vodacom which i had to spend up to 2000 only data in a month but since i ported to  Telkom i received amazing data bundle packages. With R500 your able to get 12GB for only a month which is very awesome for forex trading and bitcoin mining. Telkom all the away!!!!!!!!!!,1,5,2
"Compliment I recently joined Telkom mobile and im extremley happy with the network. What makes me.more happy is that, when my data gets depleted they notify me immediately,pause my internet and give me an option of using out of bundle data rate or top up my data. Unlike other networks that robs us daily, no notifications on depleted bundles and you get switched automatically to airtime when your data is finished. Even when they notify you,  seconds after switching data off, your airtime is gone.Big Ups Telkom you are indeed south Africa's leading network.",1,5,31
"Cell phone contract Hi, i bought a phone P10 Huawei in September the 26th 2017. The agreed payment for this phone it was R269.00 since then i haven't paid this amount.

End of December they have debited R852. 00 which it came as a surprise to me i when to the shop were i bought the phone they told me that is the speeding limit which their call center said is on the zero rand. And again end of January it came the same amount. And again my contract doesn't have my physical address and my email as a result I am pay but I don't know for what and i was paying for the postal bill.

"Pathetic Service The 5 stars measure the pathetic service provider called Telkom.
I reported a fault on my Adsl and phone line on 20 November. A technician fro Open Serv came out on the 27 January and advised that there was nothing he could do as the contract I have is for a 4meg line and the line speed is only 2 mega as the transmitter was over 5km away.Telkom sold me this package 2 years ago as I have been having ongoing problems with my Adsl and have been out of service at least twice a year for over a month at a time.
Although my service has been out for over a month on each occasion, Telkom only gives me part credit of one third of my bill.
I have now refused to pay my account and asked that I be upgraded to fibre. Over 10 days has gone by and when I called I was told that my application was turned down as my account was not paid. I had logged a dispute on my account on 2 fronts. I cannot pay for a service I do not have and I have been paying for a 4 meg line in a 2 meg zone. I also called to have my service cancelled but they advised that I cannot do it telephonically.
I am now 62 years and can honestly say that there is no entity more useless than Telkom.
Telkom does not exist except for a bunch of  happy chippies collecting the big bucks.
I promise I can go on and on about my personal experiences with Telkom. Maybe I should write a book on the circus called TELKOM",1,5,2
"20gb + 20gb Black Friday special for R199 irregularly billed In November we signed up for the telkom movile data deal special and according to our understanding the bill was set to R199 monthly and if the data depleted we had to wait till the 1st of next month to access contracts data during the month of Jan as per norm with telkom the debit order went of for R489 and we thought it was for sim connection and subscription fees, Today we received a bill for R1300 and odd rands when we queried the bill we were told that over and above the R199 theres R500 allocated for usage and that has not been applied for by anyone to access the additional allocated amount and if we wanted more data and a higher bill we would have taken a higher data allocation contract , we are not willing to pay over and above the subscription amount as there was no agreement enterned into by us and telkom with regards to accessing the additional amount allocated on the contract",1,5,13
5 out of 5 for service I had the best service from Telkom this week. Logged a call that my fibre cable had broken at 12. 14h00 the call centre phoned to say they had received the logged fault and a technician would be at the house the next day. 14h00 the next day the Openserve technician (my hero) arrived with his ladder and toolbox. By 14h30 I was surfing the world wide web again. 16h00 the call centre phoned to ask if my fault had been resolved and closed the call. This was fabulous service.,1,5,2

"Cancellation of mobile data contract There have been so many negative reviews for Telkom Mobile of late, especially on social media I thought I better share my good story, give credit where credit is due...

In December I got an SMS saying that my contract was going to end soon and I can renew, cancel or carry on month-to-month. I decided to cancel, and seeing so many unhappy Telkom Mobile complaints on social media I though I was in for a tough fight. I sent through the cancellation forms, a few weeks later I got a phone call where they did try sell me a new contract but I stuck to my guns and said no thank you, just cancel, I have just received my statement and the cancellation seems to have gone through with no hiccups, I even got a R22.83 credit as the contract was cancelled before the full month.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm still a little worried as the debit order will only go off at the end of the month, but if they stick to their statement, which in the past they have, I'm finished, done, contract ran its full term and I'm a happy customer!

Thank you Telkom Mobile for doing what you're supposed to do.",1,5,16

"The worst mobile network in South Africa!! I wish I knew that entering into a contract with Telkom is like entering into a contract with the devil, there's no way out! I cancelled my contract with Telkom and sent the form and my ID copy back in October 2017 but this contract is still ongoing! Since December I've been making contact with the Telkom call centre and every agent tells me they will ensure this contract is cancelled, but still it is ongoing! All agents ensured me that they would escalate the matter to their team leaders. Until today this contract is ongoing. I have been incurring further costs of calling their contact centre repeatedly begging to have my contract cancelled.  I saw the reviews on Hello Peter and chose to ignore them, what a grave mistake! DO NOT be like me and NEVER get a contract with Telkom you WILL REGRET IT.",1,5,6

Good day Telkom

U guys called me and offered A Huawei fone P 10 lite for R269per month I accepted the offer 

 

My 1st bill was R468. 70 it was not covered by debit order due to insufficient funds then I was contacted that I will pay R938. 64 includes my 2nd invoice which was R468. 94 then I agreed then my line was terminated due to none payment it was. Fine

 

I called for recommendations, then I was informed that the payment has not interfaced its still with collections New Debt there is nothing they can do for me,I called again to enquiry about line reconnection  I was told that debit order went through for only R703. 98 only I was informed of this when I call to request my line to be recconected as I was advice to wait 14 working I was told i short payed Telkom with R234. 66 therefore I was not getting recconected until I pay that amount. my question to them was how was that cause I got sms from Telkom informing me that R938. 64 will be debited on the 30 of November debited order funds were sufficient I was not answered I was told to go and pay and call back with my receipt before my line is opened Oooh WOW TELKOM. I left it then.I was really tired of calling 

 

Went for my Holidays debit order went through for R503.66 on the 29 December. 

Which covers my R234. 66 outstanding which I was told to go and pay and R269 which is my monthly fone installment 

 

 on the 15th January 2018 I called to check if they received their money so that I can have my line up and running again. I noticed an sms for R772. 66 was debited by Telkom my goodness

 

Agent told me R503.66. is not reflecting yet its still with collections I must call  ********** 328 and ask them if they received the money. My goodness what should I do to get my services from Telkom my line has not been working since November,  I put the fone down

I called I again the agent. was so More confused I had to tell her what to check she told me she can see the payment for R503.66. was pain on the 5 or the 8 December from collections ,she can also see I must pay R772. 66 on the 1st of January. She was also surprised when I told her that the money has been debited this morning.

 

Why must I pay R772. 66 when u Telkom and ur collectors and ur system takes 4 ever to interface? 

 

Telkom iam up to the brim with ur service ek is GAT VOL what do u want from me vele.

 

Ur collections transfer money late to the system and I must suffer for that. 

 

Today I went to the bank to reverse that debit order of money they took yesterday guess what the bank charges me for that I have to drive,  my petrol money who is going pay me back for that. Iam still with no service 

 

My 1st bill was R468. 70

2nd bill R469. 94

3rd bill 503.66

That is all and I have paid for this

R703. 98 paid

"Impressive customer service For once I can write a review about a Telkom consultant that isnt bad. I would like to thank Millendah from the telkom store in Rosebank mall for her great attitude and service. She has gone out of her way to assist us when were not getting feedback or assistance from anyine else in telkom. If only all Telkom staff could be this efficient we would not have the amount of complaints about the service provider that we currently have.

thanks again",1,5,2
"An incredible story of customer service! Dear Telkom: today you sent me a mail threatening to list me with the credit bureau for non-payment. Since the 1st of August last year I have been trying to have my line cancelled: I have mailed your cancellation address with the correct forms, I have followed up with your customer service agents, I have gone to your branches, I have texted your webchat helpers, I have even posted and inboxed you right here on Facebook with evidence of all of my attempts to cancel and stop the billing. Nothing has stopped you. You are now marking my attempts to reach you as spam. For nearly 6 months, you have continued to bill me for a line that I canceled on 1 August, and now you are going to blacklist me. I have never missed a bill payment, even yours, and now YOU ARE GOING TO DESTROY MY CREDIT RECORD and send debt collectors after me. Please, if somebody who works at Telkom actually reads this, please realize what you are doing here and help me prevent this from happening.",1,5,1

"Line on new contract still not working It is such a pity that a technical problem will cause excellent service from the store sales lady to completely make me regret the decision to take up a new contract with Telkom. I signed up for two new lines and they were issued on 21 December. One line works and the other one does not. The lady from the store  has phoned me three times to update me that there is still no resolution. This is frustrating and absolutely appalling! Of all the network providers, I chose Telkom, these were gifts for my children, I have one happy one and one extremely sad one! In spite of the store sales lady trying to assist, I find that the problem is obviously not to do with her, she has done her job, and however lines are activated has not! If this matter cannot be resolved ASAP, then this contract must be cancelled and I can get a contract from a service provider who actually is going to provide a working service!",1,5,34

"Gareth Reed - Top Top Service! Let me start of by saying I am not your typical Telkom fan. (much like others on this platform). However, from time to time I feel its appropriate to give a good rating, and in this case I want to applaud Gareth Reed from Telkom / Openserve that installed fibre at my residence. 

He was on time and professional, and worked the entire day to install fibre (from what I can gather) on a very difficult site. He explained everything to me in easy to understand terms, and overall I was really happy with the service I received.

Well done, and thank you again Gareth!",1,5,8
Excellent service from Launa Molapo!!! My Telkom Mobile line was disconnected the beginning of December due to a failed debit order that I was not aware of as I was overseas from the 29th of November. I only found this out on the 18th of December when I got back and saw that my Telkom lines were all disconnected (a total of 3 contracts) and I really started stressing. The November and December payments were debited on the 19th and 20th of December and I then sent proof of payment off numerous times to different email addresses to try and get my lines reconnected. After struggling for nearly 2 weeks Launa Molapo was able to help me reconnect my lines. I emailed proof of payment to other call centre agents who promised to help me but I never got any feedback from them so I was incredibly grateful to Launa Molapo for helping me and being so eager to help. Thank you Launa!!!,1,5,44

I compare this to a Booking.com reservation where they just washed heir hands off it and said they can't or won't help. Remember this when choosing a platform.",1,5,4

The first card replacement is free thank you for that I will now make sure I do not lose the new one.

He could not send me a survey or feedback as it expires in seconds and I was driving. SAFETY of the customers first. I appreciate that. Since I couldn't do it cos I driving,  i am writing this to give him recognised feedback. Forgot his name. You can call me and figure out who i spoke to.",1,5,64

Over exceeding service Let me tell you a story about my new favorite bank... :-) so I requested to be contacted by Discovery regarding their banking products... This was a Sunday guess what 1st thing in the morning I received a call from a friendly enthusiastic and well informed consultant.she gave me all the options in detail and when I made a decision it was an informed one. I was then told to download the app and finalize my request. From there I struggled to verify my details but this did not slow down the process in any way because I was getting constant calls from consultants trying to help me. I must say they help also encouraged me. It this point I was more determined to be part of this bank asap. I'm happy to say that the DSV driver just delivered my card and iv never been so excited to start this journey with any bank,1,5,7

Having said that, the staff at discovery bank came to me rescue, they friendly, willing to go beyond their job titles and even when it was not their duty to assist they did it anyways. I required my Id to collect my new card, I slipped up there, offered my driver license, as in my mind its a form of identity, wrong again. Discovery bank's staff offered to print me a copy of my ID, all I needed was a to send it via email. Grateful for that I made some calls, send them the copy, and again the friendly staff, took up the responsibility, and printed me a copy on their time and expense.

From the moment I clicked on the online link, to the time I recieved my card at my workplace, it was a seemless and enjoyable experience to say the least. They were always updating me day by day to advise the progress on application to the delivery of my card. I wish I could remember the consultants name who gave me a call and handled my application via the phone and even called me to assist me installing the app until I was satisfied. I applaud Discovery and would advise anyone who is looking to switch banks, to definitely use Discovery Bank. Thank you (^^,)",1,5,5
"Discovery Bank Discovery Bank have been absolutely great with a dispute I lodged against a purchase I made online.
This was not taken lightly. I had scrutinized the website. I had read the suppliers terms and conditions and policy information and felt reasonably comfortable. The transaction was simple enough, however when I checked the bank transaction it was uncomfortable. Also, the delay in delivery was substantial. There was no contact about the delivery or possible delays.

Discovery Bank staff member asked for the details, explained the process and what I needed to do.
They emailed me the dispute form and asked for as much information as possible, which I supplied.
They followed through by email keeping me informed of the most significant details in the process and the final outcome.",1,5,11
"Thank you Discovery My personal experience with this bank has been nothing but amazing and professional. I have been with FNB for over a decade,tried applying for a credit card and turned down everytime even though my accounts were healthy and my business bringing in constant revenue. Discovery from day 1 of my application literally held me by the hand through out the process,and 3 days later granted me a Gold Credit Card and some other benefits for free. I just joined them but already feel appreciated as a client by a bank for the first time. Thank you Discovery Bank,,,,",1,5,1

Service is the best at this bank.

Now please tell which other bank is open 24 hours and will make sure the debit order was refunded in such a quick manor ?

"Poor service Discovery Bank L
I have been trying to get my discovery credit card closed since 3 September 2021.i paid the full amount and sent an email to close this account. No one responded. Instead there have been numerous charges accumulating on the account, which I also paid. I called in yesterday to ask for this account to be closed. I was given a case number **********. Today I received a missed call from their number. I called back several times and was not authenticatied. I received another call from them which I answered but no one was at the other end of the line. I finally got through and spoke to Junya. She was of no assistance whatsoever. She told me that someone will call me. I am not always available on the cell phone, so people cannot call whenever they feel like it. I am quite perturbed by the fact that she told me that I cannot contact anyone from Discovery Bank via email. Why is that? In what Era are we living in? She said that if no one can get hold of me then I must wait for someone to contact me via email. This is ridiculous! In the meantime they keep charging me fees when I requested closure more than 6 weeks ago! I advised them of the times that I am available today . Noone contacted me.I advised them further thant if I do not receive an email, I will post this on every media platform and contact their CEO 's office directly. I am sick and tired of being given the run around by them. I texted them on FB and they promised me that someone will call me. But nothing materialized. So I will contact Hylton tomorrow.",1,5,4

"Financial Analyser Function Well done on the new financial analyser functionality! I am thoroughly enjoying playing around with it. Some teething problems of course (such as having to manually categorise my vehicle finance and tracker transactions for each month from Sept 2019 to date due to the match algorithm not picking them up, maybe try a reference match thats not 100%?). Also it appears that even when setting the budget on 3 months spend, it still kicks out 12 months data for some reason... but otherwise I'm still happy with how my budget turned out and the alert function especially :)",1,5,19

Remember i received R87000. And I transfer R101000. Please help me cz now I can't do anything because of that. If they suspect fraud they must take that R87000 back and carry on with my account",1,5,2
"Rocky start, but great rewards, and effortless banking experience since. I've been a Discovery Bank customer now for around 6 months. After a rocky start signing up with a negative review here, the subsequent months have been smooth sailing. 

I changed over from FNB as Discovery Miles seemed a more attractive reward program than eBucks. My decision was cemented when my interest rate on a Flexi Deposit account, was higher with R1000, than a similar account at FNB with R40,000+, that I'd had open for years.

In summary, the bank has worked for me flawlessly since I've joined, and the rewards are top notch (with the caveat that I have Medical Aid and Insurance with Discovery as well, greatly boosting it).

Just wanted to post a bit of support for the team, as I've truly enjoyed my experience.

No complaints, just a few comments. My daughter received her card today, thank you, we now have a second family member banking with discovery.
1. When are you going to launch a youth account? My son is only 11 and can't open an account, and trying to open with other banks when I don't bank with them is impossible. So he currently doesn't have a bank account for him to learn to manage his money.
2. When are you going to launch homeloans and vehicle financing? As your loyal clients, and happy ones at that, we are tired of being abused by other banks as we try get home financing. Wouldn't it be easier if all my products were with my bank? 

Thank you in advanceKe",1,5,66

"Great Service by Kristin!!! I would like to express my joy and gratitude at the awesome service I received from Kristin at Discovery Bank new accounts division. I had been trying to open a discovery bank account since October 2020 without success because I had fallen victim to identity theft fraud. I had been transferred to all the divisions at Discovery Bank and I had spoken to many different agents without a successful outcome. On the 11th of May 2021 I was blessed when I was put through to Kristin, she followed and investigated my matter from my first account application attempt while she asked me to hold. She asked me to forward to her the documents I had sent to fraud division. She promised to call me back, which unlike the other agents who promised to call back but never did, she called me back the very same day and she told me she had resolved my issue. Within 2 days my account was opened, today my card was delivered and activated. Kristin's work ethic and professionalism showed me what companies can achieve with the right staff who are fit for purpose and passionate about what they do. Kristin is a true professional and a real asset to Discovery Bank, thank you so so much, your service was the best I have ever received from Discovery Bank. You rock, keep it up Kristin!

I have my credit card with them, transactional, and savings. I'll never use another bank again. From handling general queries to emergency withdrawal requests and more, this bank has gone above and beyond what I'd expect.

I really hope they never change. I can happily recommend them to anyone and I often do.",1,5,34

Having gone through probably the most traumatic experience of my life whereby we had a home invasion/robbery whereby myself and my family were held by gun point and tied up as they ransacked the place. I called Discovery Bank in order to access my funds and online banking having blocked my profile after all this. I was blessed to be connected with Phathu who owned my problems from start to finish and did not pass me though to another person. He helped me re activate my account, re-access my online status, thought me Apple Pay, order a replacement card etc. That guy did everything and could not stop at complimenting him with a call service rate. That man deserves a statue. Phathu. Thank you very much. Your service justified my move to your bank when I had been so fed up by the “other bank”. God bless you and yours.",1,5,7

If joining a bank was done with Anver, or for that matter, joining anything, I'd do it twice. I would highly recommend speaking and dealing with him when joining Discovery Bank.",1,5,1

Discovery Bank - Incredible service and friendly Staff I cannot recommend this bank enough. I was looking for a bank that had affordable fees so that I could open an account for savings and side hustles. At R10 per month the discovery gold transaction account was perfect. I sent in an inquiry on the website and within 2 minutes I received a call and in a total of 10 minutes my account was open. I am still baffled at how fast the process was and I DID NOT HAVE TO GO INTO A BRANCH which was my biggest issue with other banks. Fabulous service and friendly staff! I feel secure and I feel that my money is safe. The card is super pretty too;) I can't wait to start my saving journey with SA's first behavioral bank! Thank you Discovery Bank!,1,5,6

"DISCOVERY BANK - WAY TO GO! This is hands down, the best service I have received from a company in a long time.  I ordered my card, received it within a week - the card was delivered to my business address.  I did not have to drive to a bank, had no human interaction - only the app.  So easy and user friendly.  When I needed assistance, an agent sorted me out with friendly and efficient service.  ",1,5,2

Give that lady a bells! Dianne N is a breath of fresh air. Helpful beyond the call of duty. I was about to lose all faith in Vitality and Discovery Bank until I finally got  hold of a voice and it happened to be Dianne. She reassured me that she would make sure she got to the bottom of my Apple watch/credit card query. She phoned me back in the afternoon when I could not answer so she phoned me in the evening so that she could stick to her commitment. She had also resolved the query. She is an absolute star!!

"The future of banking  As a professional in the tech industry I understand what I takes to innovate and build a banking system from the ground up and in the short space that Discovery did. 

Just like any other system there will always be issues. The developers and engineers must keep on squashing those bugs until they get it right and keep giving us more innovative features.

I have signed up for the Platinum Collection and excited to be part of this innovation journey.",1,5,4
"Im a new person because of Discovery! PS: I will def invest in your shares as time goes on!!! I'm very happy with my discovery EVERYTHING to be honest.  
I was never a discovery client. Not on any platform.  Heard about it from family and friends and never really looked for products like this.  Till the day I lost my job due to being a whistleblower. Never the less, I am not almost on my legs again. 

I got Discovery medial aid.  PS way better than my goverment GEMS! 
Then digged a bit more and more about Discovery Bank. 

I am officaly a month and a 6 days with your bank.  I didnt transfer all my money just yet, but will surely do so in the coming months and start using my Discovery Bank only.  PS From FNB Private clients!

Everyone ever in debt, bad stances or what ever it may be that keeps holding you back from living your TRUE LIFE. Join Discovery bank and really learn how to manage your life better by doing the things they teach you. PS: Lovely educational vides!

Never the less, I am now active at the gym, turning my life a full360 degrees. Never was I active in my life for 33 years like now!  Got my health checked and now realized how important not just my mental health is but also my Physical and Finacial health is.  

All factors combined how Discovery Bank has cahgned my life and my willingness to go on with life has changed.  

Thank you for the amazing gift no one has ever been able to teach me.  A behavioral first bank, I agree!!!!

"Keep up the good work! This is my second review. Note this only relates to the Gold ""pay as you use"" Transactional Account as I do not have a credit card at this point. 

I had to give 5 stars as this is the most seamless transactional account I've ever had.  Great upfront pricing, charges are loaded instantly and aside from a few buffering issues while adding beneficiaries with the app, I could do all that I wanted without problems. I also watched the short educational videos. No bells and whistles, just on point, comprehensive financial education and a great product to help me get the results I want. I'm already changing the way I spend and save. 

Thanks Discovery, if the future is behavioral banking, I think I'm in good hands!",1,5,19

"Discovery Bank l Disrupting done right As a user of the big 5 banks, Discovery’s offering intrigued me. Let’s see how they stack up.

As an early adopter, and a power user of all things tech, I read the email that I’ve finally made it into one of the groups in the rollout in August.

Big-ups choosing taking it slow and rolling out in phases, not sitting with a load unforeseen load issue somewhere where you didn’t expect it.

Setup and application; wonderful UX, you know what to do when, the design is clean, layouts guide your interactions.

Day to day: You guys made an awesome app. There was a small jiggle, which I contacted your devs on, the rest, just amazing.

From constant contact re delivery of my cards, follow up on whether I did manage to sort an issue, short turnaround on my queries and immediate fraud query calls at 11:40 pm re a €1 transaction.

And this is just the start.

Disclaimer: I do NOT work at Discovery Bank",1,5,3
"Very happy and looking forward to great rewards So impressed with the switch I have made. One realises that there will be teething problems in the beginning, but to date they have assisted and corrected every problem I had after registration. The registration was a smooth and easy process, the staff professional and the benefits for healthy banking already looks great if you apply the principals. Amazing app on phone!",1,5,19
"Prompt response to concerns raised in my earlier review. I feel happy that my first query and post was efficiently and promptly adressed by Discovery Bank. Thank you As a follow up from my last post. I just wanted to add that I received a very prompt and enlightening response from Discovery Bank, outlining the correct information on various banking packages available and the process going forward. They also undertook to upload more information outlining what was discussed with me over the phone on to their website so that any misinformation out there is clarified. They also said that the option to later add a current account on teh banking app would be available at a later stage. As well as various glitches on the app will be rectified (for example the option to select a cheque account in the original application on the app was not available to me, as well as the app creating duplicate versions of accounts I wanted to create). I hope they rectify this soon, and add the extra functionality to the app and more information on the website soon. I look forward to being able to open my Cheque account and continue this process sooner rather than later.",1,5,10
"Fantastic Customer Care  To the Discovery Credit Card team - THANK YOU! Outstanding customer care & customer service.  I have had a credit card with Discovery for many years. Needed to have it closed as I have immigrated. In November 2018 I emailed my request with the minimal 1 page document account closure form. For whatever reason, the account was never closed. I was charged with various things including interest. I emailed in April and again in July 2019 thinking that I was going to be held liable for all the charges, etc.... cos honestly that's how it goes when you dealing with these types of errors. To my surprise and amazement Discovery Card responded, closed down and REVERSED all the charges within 4 days. No extra paper work, no forcing me to pay for something that was their mistake. Now that's customer service. What a surprise and relief. Would definitely open an account with them again in a heartbeat if I were living in SA. ",1,5,1
"Discovery Bank: Excellent Service. This is to thank  Malehlohonolo (Nolo) Makwakwa for the great service provided.

On Monday, 09 July 2019, I had completed a credit card payment to a service provider but immediately the payment went into pending status. Upon realising this, I called the Discovery Bank to find out what had happened. I was fortunate enough to have been assisted by Nolo, who told me not to worry and advised that all should be sorted out soon. She followed up later on Monday to advise me that the team responsible for clearing payments was looking into this and to hang ten. She then called me on Wednesday morning to advise me that the payment had cleared. She didn't have to do this at all. She went over and above what was required, and this showed me that she kept an eye on my query and didn't move it to another department or another person.  The fact that she called back means more than she'll ever know.
Thank you Nolo. KEEP UP THE GOOD WOR****!!",1,5,10

"Outstanding service Outsurance  is the best insurance ever, I have been with them for more than a decade now and they never disappointed me all these years when I claim.  Many insurance companies have approached me to join them but I tell them that I'm not interested even if they lower their premiums than what I'm paying at Outsurance because Outsurance is the best when it comes to client service. I recently had a faulty  geyser and I phoned Outsurance and within 30 minutes plumbers came to my house to replace the element of my geyser. This is the kind of service we need as customers, prompt and efficient service. Big up Outsurance and keep doing the excellent work you are doing. Viva! Outsurance Viva!",1,5,7

"Compliment The quickest, most friendly, absolute Profesional team of people I've ever dealt with",1,5,6
Great feedback After initially posting a review highly critical of OUTsurance I have to say that the service I received subsequently was absolutely fantastic . The company did issue a letter of apology and settled my claim. Their legal department did a sterling effort in trying to get back my excess from the third party and have already paid me one of four claims . Waiting with bated breath for the other 3 excess claims to be settled. Might reconsider moving my policy back to OUTsurance once these are settled.  Faith Chauke was very professional and a pleasure to deal with. Thank you Faith. You are definitely an asset to OUTsurance!!,1,5,4

"Wow is all I can say.  Forget the rest.  Go with the best. I would like to commend Outsurance Pet Insurance for the fantastically efficient, streamlined and friendly system they have in place.  I waited until I'd had sufficient experience to rate this company and after submitting a few claims, I'm sold.  Not only is the claims process simple and the payments super-quick, but the claims advisors are animal lovers!  Not sure how Outsurance manages to hire people who are performance driven but also compassionate about animals but they've done it and it works.  Special shout out to Claris'te Govender for being one of the most caring, decent claims advisors I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  Well done, Outsurance.  Don't change your model - it's unique and poweful.  Keep it up.",1,5,2

"Outsurance successfully fought to get excess back after crash. Outsurance without me having to press,  got me my excess back when an uninsured driver wrote off my car. Today I am getting R9,200 back - the excess payment. And Outsurance told me within 24 hours of the crash that they would pay out the full value of my car, and put that amount in my account within 48 hours!!!! I hesitated leaving an established insurance company even though monthly premiums dropped over R2,000, because I worried how good the cheaper Outsurance would be. I should not have worried, they have been fantastic. And when, within months another driver drove into me and wrote off another car, Outsurance immediately paid up again. Please use them, you won't regret it.",1,5,3

"MORE THAN EXCELLENT SERVICE I have a house insurance with outsurance. They are more than great and prompt in responding and resolving issues. The first incident was with a leaking geyser in February and the service provider they nominated failed to deliver on time and were so incompetent and demanding additional cash to relocate the geyser outside. I alerted Outsurance and they nomoninated another service provider and did everything for free. They sent an electrician to check everything. Today, the 04/11 once again they came to my rescue when my bedroom plug was faulty. Within no time an electrician was here and even gave me a free twin plug. Honestly, I can rest assured that even when something massive might happen to my property, I am in good hands.",1,5,13

"OUTstanding Personal Customer Service (Palesa Tshabalala) Good day to you,
I am deeply touched at the OUTstanding service I received from Palesa Thsabalala.

Without her knowing my history of recently diagnosed with a serious heart disease, everything breaking, cost of living hitting us all very hard and a mother that’s not doing well health wise.
Regardless of all the other very serious issues and stress I have and am dealing with, this Diamond of an Angel, has gone over and above any service I have received in this country in a looooong time!
You see, good service, I have noticed over the years, is just non existing…. That’s not just frustrating, but sad, as I have been in Customer Service for 38 years and as Company Relations Officer, I take it to heart.
   
Me feeling motherless, hopeless, stressed, without her knowing, Palesa’s kindness, friendly demeanour, soft spoken with so much care and understanding in her voice, set me at ease.  I could breathe a little.
How great it is so speak to someone so efficient in what she does, that takes each case to heart.  Her inner beauty is felt through her voice.

Even though my claim could not be covered as I had thrown items away, (which I now know – DON’T).  Just hearing Palesa, explaining clearly, in a decent manner, her patience and calming voice….
She deals with you, with passion, compassion.  Palesa is a gem! I know and I can imagine, that I am not the only one thinking this.  It’s such a pity, that not everyone goes through the trouble of giving thanks.
Of showing gratitude, taking the trouble and sending praises to those who truly deserve it.

We are all going through tough times, in some way or another. So besides what Palesa is also dealing with, her beautiful soul is evident as she dedicates herself to me as if I am the only person, the only case.
To hear that…..I don’t have the correct words to describe my gratitude and her greatness!

She is unique and deserves ”Outstanding Customer Service of the Year”.
Going the extra mile merely in kindness, efficiency, patience etc...is exemplary!

From me, a very big, from deep down in my heart, Thank You Palesa.  You make a difference and you make this world a better place!!!
OUTsurance, you can be very proud of this wonderful employee!",1,5,2

We were treated with such kindness, care and concern, updating us and guiding us through the entire process and answering all of our questions timeously.

I did not take the insurance due to the fact that it was expensive but the service i received from Julia was absolutely out of this world. I even forgot that she was selling something to me, i felt like i knew her for many years. If it wasn't due to my financial position at the moment, i believe i would have taken the insurance irrespective of the price. Her service is brilliant, she make you understand and also give you a chance to say something during her presentation. Julia is the only sales representative that i have enjoyed her conversation in my entire life because she sound so friendly and very patient and welcoming at the same time.

Amazing customer service I added our puppy to our existing policy. Great service as always. Amazing friendly consultant. This is why I will never move to any other insurer. Keep up the good work,1,5,7
"Thanks for a good experience I was with outsurance for an uninterupted 3 years, and would still be with them had we not left the country.  We were insured with them for home contents, out and about as well as our vehicle.
Every claim was processed quickly, the app is effective in getting them to call back, as well as other basic features.  The customer service received has been rivaled only by one other competitor, but we'd still rate them better because of our experience with their systems.
We shopped around in 2021 and got more competitve quotes, but the service with onboarding was below what we'd experienced with Outsurance, so we decided to pay a little more, for that added peace of mind and customer service.
If/when they come to the UK, they will be the obvious choice for us.",1,5,3

"Outstanding Customer-Centricity from Bradley Satram of Outsurance!!! I recently had the wonderful experience of speaking with Bradley Satram, a Consultant at Outsurance who assisted me with a quote for my household and car insurance.
What a breath of fresh air, a giggle a minute, an enthusiastic, passionate employee, with detailed knowledge and understanding of the Outsurance product, a consummate professional who by all accounts seemed to go 'above and beyond' in the call to me, but what I realised is standard practice and is the level of incredible service delivery, and customer-centricity he offers all his potential clients.  He was delightfully humorous and made the experience one I will fondly remember.  I have had a number of dealings with insurance companies and my encounter with Bradley made my day and made an otherwise fairly tedious process fly by with his very cleverly-witted little quips.  He had me in hysterics at times...was wonderful to laugh and be entertained by this fantastic gem of a Consultant at Outsurance.

Speedy and efficient roadside assistance My car would not start this morning so I phoned OUTsurance to use the roadside assistance that they offer to their customers. Not even 10 minutes later the truck had arrived and I was assisted.

"Outsurance for OUTSTANDING service and premiums! Received excellent service from Outsurance.  I contacted them on the app to cancel my contract as I was purchasing a new vehicle, seconds later they called.  The plan was to cancel and shop around before making a decision.  I was given a quote and then transferred to a senior consultant, Francis Monisi.  He said as a Customer of 11 years they did not want to lose my business and offered me a premium of 25% less than my current premium.  The new vehicle is obviously worth much more - so it was mind boggling. He also gave me advise on getting a proper comparison if I called the other Insurance Company and never once slated their service.  I contacted them but the service and premium could not compare even close and I called Outsurance the next day to renew my insurance with them.
Today I called with my new registration number and the lady on the other side was such a fresh breeze and so friendly and professional.  Dealing with Outsurance is only a pleasure!",1,5,7

"Best service received from Charles Van Rooyen (complaints department) Recently I raised a complaint regarding terrible service I received from Imbazo Plumbing (a service provider of Outsurance) and was assisted by Charles Van Rooyen from Outsurance to resolve my problem. I had issues regarding shoddy workmanship and a lack of customer service by the plumber and raised my concerns with Outsurance, who had referred the plumber to me. Shortly after raising my complaint with Outsurance, Charles contacted me and got Wayne from Imbazo to finally meet with us and commit to a refund due to the poor workmanship on the plumbing job they did. 

As that process was unfolding, Charles would follow up with us for developments and even followed up to ensure that we had received the refund from Imbazo Plumbing. 

I would like to thank Charles for the sterling service and for reminding me why Outsurance has been my trusted insurance provider for so many years - I do not believe I would have received assistance and a refund, would it not have been for him and Outsurance. Thank you so so much Charles!",1,5,58

I have to transport kids to school, my wife to work and I also need to go to work. The reply I got from them was, they can't it's only for 30 days and I'm stranded with no transport while I the process was being delayed by them. And if outsurance serve their clients like this.

"Outsurance gives better options for people whos vehicles are paid I spoke to Nolo from outsurance to see if I can get the R500 if they cannot decrease my premium. She told me about a different car insurance other than the comprehensive that I am currently on at a different insurer. I was unaware that the comprehensive plan is more suitable for people whos vehicles are still under a hire purchase agreement and that you have to pay quite a big amount excess in case of a claim. She then told me about another option that is better for me. I work from home and my car is a 2005 model.  I won't be asked for excess and if my car is written off,  I will be able to keep my car and sell the parts or fix it up, where other insurers take your car. This is a great option. My premium is now down from R396.08 to R241.31. Downside is that I didn't get the R500 because they beat the previous provider's price. Well don Nolo! May you get extra leave, an increase AND a bonus. Thank you for your friendly service. I wish more people can get this type of customer care in our country",1,5,2

Great service I would like to compliment the great service I got regarding my claim and the quick responses I got when communicating with outsurance claims administrator and everyone else involed in the claims process.,1,5,8
Staff members at Outsurance I have asked Julia Lamekinane for a quote on car and household insurance. She really tried her best to help us and were the whole time very professional and helpful. I could not speak to her at some stage and she phoned us back and tried to help us with a better quote and when I decided on Santam as our insurer she did not discredit the company like one of Discovery sales persons have done. She is definitely a ambassador for Outsurance. The reason why we did not make use of Outsurance is that Santam’s monthly payment was less then Outsurance for the same type of cover.,1,5,2
"Excellent Service-Chris Emdon,Veronica Hansen and Ian Knoesen Just a big thank you to the team at outsurance. Our claim has not been completed as yet but the assistance received from every single person in the claim process so far is beyond Excellent.

Wonderful Service from Claim & Ratish Kandhai I had an accident and I was traumatized so I didn't get all the details and I didn't know how the process worked at all. RATISH KANDHAI helped me patiently and efficiently and answered all my questions with allot of details and for someone like me that is very great. His response time on emails is less than expected and he got my claim approve in less than 24 hours and the repairer called me less than 4 hours after the claim was approved as well. I am very impressed and if this kind of service continues I will be a life-er at Outsurance!,1,5,25

"Outsurance excess review I recently had to submit a claim to Outsurance for damage caused by a lightning strike. To my horror, I found that my excess for this claim has, unbeknown to me, been increased from zero to R4500 during the course of a rerate of car insurance in 2021. I took this up with Outsurance and after a review process, Outsurance admitted that the error was caused by one of its agents and the excess was reduced to zero. I was asked to re-submit my claim and it was settled quickly and completely, as one has become used to in dealing with Outsurance.  The way this was handled and settled, just confirmed my absolute trust that the 20+ years that I have been covered by Outsurance was and still is the best option for me!",1,5,5
"Outsurance just don't care anymore! Don't even try to become a customer of Outsurance. Outsurance is OUT OF DATE, they LACK INSIGHT and they DO NOT CARE about CUSTOMERS. The company is eager to advertise on any possible platform but they are not willing to speak to customers. I have a policy number, my debit order is in place but OUTSURANCE refuses to fulfill their promises to me. If I do not hear from Outsurance today (29/03/2022)  I will have no choice than to cancel my debit order. I will be forced to search for a more trustworthy INSURANCE company than an incompetent OUTSURANCE company.",1,5,23

"Well done Zandre for the Excellent service I have been with the company for a few years now but never made a claim. Last year June we added our new property onto our cover. Last week I had to put through a claim after a storm and 3 of our 9 air-cons wouldn't switch on again.

You can only imagine how hesitant I was since, it was less than a year we had our cover and we all know the horror stories we hear about any insurance claims that are requested. 
I had the pleasure of speaking to Zandre Hayton in the claims department on the 14th March.
He advised me of the process and what would be required to forward the claim. He was kind, friendly and ever so helpful in answering all my questions and concerns. I submitted all of the required documents on Tuesday the 22nd of March and received a call from Zandre that same afternoon to say my claim was approved and monies will be paid out within the next 2 to 3 days! 
Imagine my surprise and pleasure. I honestly expected a longer turn around time thought that there would be issues with my claim.

I definitely would recommend Outsurance to others and I would like to thank Zandre for the fantastic job he did and say keep up the excellent work! Your level of customer service definitely deserves acknowledgement.",1,5,7

OUTSURANCE = honest insurance",1,5,29
"The best insurance company in SA!!!! I recently had to go through the claims process with outsurance. I cannot emphasize enough how pleasantly delighted I was with the service. They are friendly, competent and fair. Maputo from the emergency department has won me over. She is passionate, competent and most of all a REAL brand ambassador for the company. Due to this I am going to move over my 4 house and 4 car to outsurance as their service is exceptional. I always believed in sticking to the more high end insurance companies believing that they would be less hassle to deal with but the outsurance service has left me with no doubt that I have made the wrong decision for so many years and that I have been sleeping on the best insurance company in the country. Maputo from the emergency department and Melida from the claims department you both deserve to be recognized as brand ambassadors for the company. Keep it up",1,5,1

"Always a pleasure I had an incident where my right wheel rim was cracked and had to be replaced. During this only one tire got replaced, I then felt unsure as it is often recommended to replace tires in pairs, I disputed this and queried that I was not happy with my claim, each time I got escalated until I arrived at a manager called Cornell, he patiently sat with me on the phone explaining all the details and helping me understand and we came to an agreement regarding this deviation. It was so nice to feel so taken care of and to have them do nothing short of hearing me out and not treating me as if I was a nuisance and understood that I needed peace of mind. Thanks for always doing such a great job as my insurer! I am always nothing short of satisfied and at peace",1,5,9
"Outstanding Service I have no words to express my gratitude , thanks for choosing outsurance as our car insurance. Year 2020 my car was involved in an accident and they fix it without any complications on top of that they refunded all my excess since the other driver was the one who was wrong. Imagine the car was not even drove by myself and was out of its province. This is the most reliable , reasonable car insurance ever.",1,5,10
Good service Simply the best insurance company. I was once  stuck on the N1 between  Three Sisters and Beaufort West 03h00 am in the morning  and the  lady who answered my call gave me and my family peace of mind .

I've been a client since 2006 and am very, very happy with the company and its agents. Thanks Mbali, you rock and deserve something special from your company!",1,5,5

"Outsurance bo! Vergun my asb om langs hierdie platform te vermeld van die uitstaande diens wat ons van Outsurance ontvang het:
'n Makelaar van Outsurance het per abuis foutiewe inligting aan ons deurgegee wat tot 'n dispuut gelei het.  In die opneem van hierdie aangeleentheid het ons met Quinton Kruger kennis gemaak.  Hy, in samewerking met sy span,  het hierdie hele aangeleentheid ongelooflik professioneel gehanteer en uiteindelik in ons  guns beklink.
Die terugvoer en hantering van hierdie saak  deur Quinton was uitsonderlik.  Hy was uiters vriendelik, hulpvaardig, begrypend en het sy woord gestand gedoen.
Deurgaans is ons op hoogte gehou van vordering en binne enkele dae was alles afgehandel.
In 'n tyd waar dienslewering baie agteruitgegaan het en integriteit eintlik nie meer bestaan nie, was dit 'n hartsverblywende ervaring om diens op hierdie vlak te kon ervaar.
""Hats off"" vir Outsurance!",1,5,1
"Apology to Outsurance One of the biggest mistakes of my life was to leave Outsurance for Kingprice. I was enticed by the promise of low decreasing premiums. The King is quick to recruit (most efficient at registering new clients) but slow, in fact unwilling, to settle. I had a hellish experience making a claim. It took over a month for Kingprice to conclude and settle my claim. In fact I had to take to social media and lodge a complaint with the Ombuds. Two and half months on, I am still to have my car back on the road. Compare this with Outsurance. I remember one terrible year I had three successive claims and they settled without questions, because that’s  what insurance is for, to have your back when things go unexpectedly wrong. Given my current situation with Kingprice, I can only appreciate better Outsurance’s way of handling claims. This is to say, Outsurance was (and probably still is) not only good, but way better than Kingprice in handling claims. Kingprice specialises in recruiting rather than covering customers.",1,5,4

They never ever gave me problems not even once.Yoh...I opted for less..DOTSURE...who later scammed me and added THREE MORE Policies in my Car insurance one.

I wrote off my mother's vehicle last year, and  had ahouse burglary shortly afterward as well, so needless to say, stress levels were extremely high at the time. Outsurance was my my mother's insurerr at the time, and Outsurance made the claim process so easy and stress-free, it was so refreshing!

"Excellent claim experience with Outsurance I want to commend Outsurance for EXCELLENT service. I was stuck tonight and logged a roadside assistance request. Katlego Martin assisted me and was very helpful and professional. She said that it usually takes about 30 minutes for a tow truck to get to me.

But, Waleed of Compass Towing was at my location in under 5 minutes and got me going with a jumpstart. He even left his number with me in case I got stuck again on the way home.

I must say that I have been very happy with the service of Outsurance.  Claims are fuss free and settled quickly. 

I was a bit hesitant in the beginning to choose Outsurance because usually cheaper premiums does not always mean better service, but they proved me wrong.

Definitely highly recommended.",1,5,4
"A Business Class worth 5stars service received from Cleo So yesterday morning I was called by Lady by the name Cleo I was so busy I asked her to contact me at 2pm, when she called I was still held up at work and asked her to call around 4:30pm which was at the time she knocks off to my surprise she called again and was still as friendly as on the first call. We did a quotation which she could unfortunately beat because of that I’ll be getting R1500.

On every call with Cynthia I felt at ease, I was treated with so much respect and her concern for my furry baby really touched me. She always asked about him and encouraged me that he will be okay. She's truly a gem and I hope Outsurance acknowledges what an amazing, hard working and awesome individual they have as part of the Outsurance family. Working with her assured me there was nothing to stress or worry about. She's such a bubbly and comforting soul. Hats of to you Cynthia you make Outsurance look good!

"Keitumetse Mahlangu - a true gem! Recently we experienced damage to our camera system and had to have it replaced. When we received the box it appeared as if it had already been tampered with since it already had a password which we did not have or know. For security reasons we immediately notified Outsurance who assisted us every step of the way to have the unit replaced and installed correctly. Keitumetse (Tumi) Mahlangu was so patient and checked with us regularly whether all was above board until the matter was closed. When we experienced challenges, she was right there to assist us until we received assistance.

"COMPLIMENT - MPHO CHILOANE I am writing this review on behalf of policy holders MP van Breda and B van Breda, on all previous occasions dealing with various departments, the policy holders were met with poor attitudes, an unwillingness to assist, promises of callbacks which were never met and an extreme lack of not only the relevant department but also the company and it's products. The policy holders were so disgruntled they refused to speak to any member of the Outsurance team.

Upon lodging a claim we were fortunate enough to deal with with claims advisor MPHO CHILOANE, Mpho was not only extremely professional, knowledgeable, friendly, considerate ....should I further elaborate I would have to use every positive word in the dictionary, as such I shall just sum it up as Mpho is a true gift and blessing to Outsurance, should more consultants be as proficient and willing to assist as Mpho did, dealing with Outsurance would become a true pleasure.

I truly hope Mpho receives the WELL DESERVED RECOGNITION from Outsurance as he can only be described as an ultimate model employee.

The assessors should follow Mpho's amazing example and provide more updates be it only on the claims screen, but any action Mpho had a part in was executed in such a manner that it restored some faith in Outsurance as there was none.

Mpho thank you for your great service, caring and attitude, you are one in a million! Keep up the excellent service and attitude",1,5,3

"The best company by FAR!!! We have had one hectic holiday. From my car radio braking before we leave, then my car (after we had it checked the Friday before we left) breaking down on the way to our holiday destination, then our caravan’s wheel coming off smashing through the caravan the next day and then a person crashing into the side of our family bus on the 24th of December(the driver thought my husband was turning and took a chance to speed over the road - my husband tried to miss him, but with no success). 
Through all of horrific incidences, we had the greatest service by OUTsurance! They are amazing, quick and goes the extra mile. Not once with any of our claims did we have a problem. 
From getting a flatbed(3 times may I remind you - the car, then the caravan, then the car again), to helping us with a rental vehicle and getting it upgrade to a family bus so that we could get all our belongings that use to be in the caravan back home with a big trailer, to just checking to see if we were ok, were they rude or irritated or “not you again” kinda attitude. 
I would also like to give a consultant a 100% service award 🥇 
Our consultant with most of these incidences in December, was Martika van Vuuren that went out of her way to just make things run smoothly and giving us not only insurance advice and support, but also motivating us to keep our heads up! Reminding us that we as a family were still alive(things could have been so much worse) and that this was what mattered most. 
To anyone who has anything bad to say about OUTsurance, I will be able to have a positive story that will quite them. 
WELL DONE OUTsurance!!! You will always be our NUMBER ONE insurance company!

I fully understand that he had to work within these guidelines, yet he still went out of his way to see whether Outsurance could compensate me within the policy guidelines.  He really went the ""extra mile"".

Today, I phoned Outsurance to query why this happened and was told that the consultant I spoke to can only ask for leads to new customers, and not give any financial advice. On answer to my call, I was given a slight reduction, just over R100, on my policy up until May. I have been with outsurance for over 20 years and am disappointed.",1,5,3

"72 Milner Road Repairs My claim number was **********48. My house caught fire on 26 June, and the upper story was very badly damaged. I lodged a claim with Outsurance, who sent a forensic investigator to determine the cause, and named Stephan De Beer as the Project Manager. The contractor for the building repair, which included a new roof, was Western Province Construction. The process has been a long one, lasting altogether close to five months. I am very satisfied with the way the contractors worked, keeping lines of communication open, being realistic about time frames, and maintaining a friendly, amicable and flexible attitude. I'd like to name specifically Andries Jacobs and Antoinette Visagie and their team including Zali and Tsepo, both of whom stayed in the house providing security for some weeks. 

In addition, I was able to negotiate with Western Province Construction to undertake some private work in connection with the rehabilitation of the house, which was also carried out promptly and on budget.

"Pet Insurance - Excellent Product I am EXTREMELY impressed with the Pet Insurance offered by Outsurance. We got our very spoilt, but extremely accident prone Boerboel in August of 2019. Love her to bits! But my goodness, the Vet bills are unbelievable. We joined another insurer in June 2020. For the year of our membership, they have not paid a single claim. We transferred to the Executive Plan on Outsurance a year later, and last month, our doggie broke her tooth, which unfortunately had to be removed. Her routine injections and nail trims were done at the same time. Outsurance paid for everything! They are amazing. I can honestly recommend their Pet Cover. A great product from a Top Insurer.",1,5,12

"Bianka (with a K) is a SUPER STAR! Yes she is🤩⭐️ So its the time of year again where you need to start looking at what you spend and is it the best cover. And I have filled in quite a few call back requests from a few insurers.

And OUT was one of the first to contact me back - on a holiday mind you. I was helped by Bianka (with a K 😁) and she was super helpful and friendly, helped me with quotes on all items. She was attentive to what I said and also gave me the best advice on pricing, product and all things I asked.

Needless to say I am an OUTIE again - with insurance. And maybe in future would be able to bring on over all my other things once my profiles more favourable on vehicle😅

Thank you Bianka for your help!",1,5,12
"Outsurance - service above and beyond. Fantastic service from Sethu Mafu and various others dealing with an issue that was not their fault. They stood by the whole time and their communication and feedback was faultless. Hard to believe, but I was hit from behind and my car  damaged again less than 1 month after first accident and before repairs were fully complete.
I am surprised they are still talking to me after having paid me a no-claim bonus the month before! Great to deal with a really competent and friendly bunch of people.",1,5,14

I recently claimed on my water damaged  laptop and the entire experience from start to finish with Outsurance and Ms Behariral, the agent who dealt with me was an absolute pleasure. They were fast, efficient and paid me out in full. Well done to a local company that's doing it right!",1,5,2
"OUTSURANCE -  OUTSTANDING ALL THE TIME Outsurance is OUTstanding!!!
The only company I have ever engaged with, which will ask you ""are you calling from your mobile? Can we call you back? we understand that it might be a long wait time, we are happy to call you back instead""

The only insurance company which is so transparent in their interaction with you.
Friendly, comforting and understanding employees all the time, very consistent.
They never assume mal intent when lodging a claim. They follow due diligence which is normal but for the most they are outstanding in their turnaround and solving the issues at hand!

I WOULD RECOMMEND OUTSURANCE ANYTIME! THEY ARE REASONABLY PRICED AND A GREAT BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO HAVE IN YOUR CORNER WHEN YOU NEED THEM MOST!!!!!

MOST COMPANIES IN SA SHOULD TAKE A PAGE OUT OF OUTSURANCE BOOK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND AND KNOW ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HOW TO HANDLE OR TREAT YOUR CLIENTS!",1,5,3

"Disappointed I,Sandhiya Beharie would like to state my disapointment with the above mentioned company.My late brother ,OD Maraj  I'd 610****240081,had a household insurance cover with outsurance.The premiums were paid off my bank account. When my brother passed on in January 2021,I called outsurance, and asked a consultant to cancel this policy.
I became ill with covid and
Was hospilised for just over 2 months. 
I did not reliase that my account was still debited by outsurance. 
When I found that it was still debited I called and spoke to a consultant, who then canceled that policy.
I asked outsurance in writing on 2 occasions to refund the premiums since January 2021.
I was given no reply.
I called customer care,and again I was not assisted.
I'm highly disappointed as through the years we always received excellent service from outsurance. 
I haven't fully recovered from my illness,and lost a lot of income.
Please assist

So stressed and exhausted, I called OUTsurance for assistance and got the best advisor ever. First thing first, he asked me to save my airtime he’ll call me back. He called immediately afterwards.

He asked me couple of questions not interrogation. Gave some advises and assured me my car will be fixed I shouldn’t worry. Called the dealership to organize everything. Everything he had promised, he’d delivered. I guess that’s why they call themselves Woolworths grade. 

Thank you Jason Pollen. Never met a consultant like you. Keep it up brother. You are a ⭐️.",1,5,8

"Bad Service from OUTSURANCE My experience with OUTSURANCE is very bad, First I had to get quotes regarding a claim, then had the company write a letter stating that the item needs to be replaced. Then trying to amend my policy took ages, I even sent a e-mail regarding this but still not fixed. After we eventually sorted the policy amendments out my premium was suppose to come down but to my horror Outsurance 2 days after my original payment  was deducted another amount was also taken off my policy, so instead of paying a reduced premium I now paid a lot more. Due to Outsurance's processes I could NOT speak to the same person and had to speak to a number of people.",1,5,11

"Insurance/claim experience We all know why reviews are written, either you experienced good or bad service. Well having a platform enabling clients to be heard is greatly appreciated, so a big  shout out to HelloPeter!!!
Well I just want to express my gratitude to Outsurance!!!!!! 
We had an unfortunate experience of having a break in one of our insured properties whilst my son was sleeping in his room. I do believe such an invasion sends a chill up anyone's spine. After establishing my son was fine the claim started in establishing what was taken which I dreaded. 
My, my Outsurance, both Joycelene and Annalise Viljoen proved to be angels. their helpfulness, going the extra mile in driving to our properties, one being a challenging drive to ensure a quick and correct conclusion of the claim is proof that we are insured with the correct client orientated company. Although these ladies were really the best, credit should be given to Outsurance for employing people of this caliber, Outsurance does not settle for mediocre, only the best. I was only expecting the matter to be resolved week coming, yet to my surprise this Sunday morning the personal items value was paid into my account.
Service of this nature needs to be shared, really making a difference in our challenging environment.

A big thank you to Joycelene and especially Annalise once again and Outsurance great work of providing such great service through your clients.

Kind regards

However, I was pleasantly surprised by the efficient and professional service that I received from Outsurance this week.

I called the call centre to lodge a claim for damage to my car. The claim was processed on the same day that it was lodged. I did not have to go to an assessment centre. They asked for pics of the car and the damage and got me a quote in under 2 hours.

Then something happens and the normal feedback is sorry sir you are not covered for it.

I recently had a water leak under my house, thousands of rands worth of damage my courage sank into my shoes. Then I called my insurance. Friendly service and regular good feedback and truly they bent over backwards to help me. I can tell any person if you have not yet changed from Insurer do feel free to try you will stand dumb.

However, after being transferred to the claims department my claim was processed. 
After a month, the pipes, 1 x wall, tiling and kitchen sink & cupboards have been replaced, fixed and sorted out.

I'd like to thank Nicole Africa for bearing with me by responding as soon as I've sent an email and reaching out to the relevant service providers when they've not given any feedback. She'd follow up with them and myself or husband would then get a call from the relevant plumber or carpenter. 

All in order now, but Nicole made this a less painful process. 

Thank you again Nicole. ",1,5,21

"Stranded on Old Paarl road by Outsurance My car broke down on Old Paarl Road between Klapmuts and Paarl on Wednesday 18 August 2021 at about 16:20 in the afternoon. It was far from my home. I called outsurance and spoke to a Thato. I told him that my phone battery was at 8 per cent and that I needed assistance. It was raining that day and on my way home, while driving the battery light of my Ford Fiesta went on and the car switched off while I was driving. Thankfully the car came to a stand still, but I was alone, on a road that was remote and I had 8 percent battery life. I provided all the information about location. It was near Simonsvlei, a wine Brewery place which was the only marker I could see. This was enough information for assistance as it wasn't a very long road and the brewery was the only big place in that road. I waited for assistance and Thato said they would send someone. I called a friend that I knew lived in Klapmuts before my phone died, to come so I wouldn't be there alone. When Thato called back my phone died. I waited a long time. When my friend got there I used her phone and started the process with insurance again. The lady said that the rescue was cancelled because they couldn't get a hold of me. I said that I informed Thato that my phone had died and gave him the location of where I was. She put me through to another department which told me that they will tow my car but I needed to pay an access of R4000 of which I didn't have. I was using my friends phone at the time, still stuck far away from home. I told the guy on the phone I just wanted to get home. At past 18:00 a towing company came along. Craig's towing. He said that he received a call at 16:30 but was still waiting for insurance to confirm. He then decided to just drive to loom fore when it became dark and found me. When we called outsurance again as spoke to a Gerald who said that they had cancelled the towing with Craigs because they could not get a hold of me. He said they never confirmed with him that it was cancelled. They had contacted another towing company which at this point was not there. I said it was late I wanted to get home. Gerald then said they would cancel the other towing company and have Craigs take me and the car home. If my friend had not come I would have stayed there stranded without any assistance. Anything could have happened to me and they cancel the towing company. I pay my premium every month, but to think that my life was placed in their hands and they didn't care what happened go me was disgusting. ",1,5,1

"When they stick to their Word... Would just to like to express my joy at the fact that Outsurance actually stands up to their word and delivers on their word in terms of if they cant beat your current insurance premium they will pay you either R500 or R1500 if you have had no claims in the last 3 years. After speaking to a consultant last Wednesday and going through the quote, it was confirmed I am currently paying cheaper premium with my current insurance policy. I was then called by Charles Van Rooyen on Thursday to confirm that I would in fact be paid out as I met the requirements and had proved my current insurance policy was better priced. I would like to thank the consultant I dealt with (whose name I really cant remember) as well as Charles who called me to confirm my details and confirm that payment would be done.

"Just a token of appreciation  3 weeks ago i had an encounter with my house insurance.   I was with a previous insurance before but didnt feel all good about there services.  

Then 2 months ago i changed to outsurance.  I believe its the best insurance decision any one can make. There is just something different about outsurance staff. Telecommunications staff is caring and punctual. 

Karl fourie is the lovely gentleman that assisted me with my claim. I take my hat of for the hard work and dedication that you have shown to me. My claim was approved due to karls hard work.  Thanks  outsurance you have made my life just a lil easier.  Moving into ur own house is costly and also having  to fix things is expensive.  I appreciate everything and will surely choose outsurance above any insurance.  

You have to experience bad to appreciate the good. You guys are that good to experience.  

Thanks again

"Outsurance saved the Day  I have had the pleasure of having my Car, household and Out and about Cellular insurance with Outsurance. The one thing that I know about the staff both when you have an active policy and the afterservice, the consistency never changes. 
About 2 months ago, my son who does learn online accidently dropped his tablet, his screen was damaged and he could no longer use his device for learning purposes. 
Obviously I did not have R 5000 to buy a new one, and my daughter reminded me that I have cover on our devices. I called immediately, the friendly claims advisor Richard was ever so helpful, sending my claims details. The process was simple, easy, the service provider were friendly , even so much as to come out to collect the damaged device, and have my claim sorted in no less than 5 working less. 
I must commend Outsurance for not only retaining their ethical values as it shows they genuinely care for their customers. I certainly appreciate my Insurance Company . Thank you for always going the extra mile. My son is happy to be back online with his new tablet. You really saved the day!!!! ",1,5,21
"Outsurance Insurance company Insurance is only needed when things go wrong. Fortunately over the many years we have not had to claim much from Outsurance. As luck would have it we have had to make 2 claims this year. Dealing with the Contact center is easy and efficient.

Recently my car broke down. I dealt with Larmiy Masuku. She arranged a tow truck, it was like ordering an Uber. The online app, showed me where the truck was and it arrived within 20 mins of my call. Not only that Larmiy called me at least 4 times to ensure all was well. Thank you",1,5,10

I need to know that they will have my back if anything, from a catastrophe to a complete disaster, should befall me.   What I don't want is a company that tries to wriggle out of their obligations.  Well, Outsurance deliver.  Of course, they have to ask for proof, paperwork and a host of other stuff to make sure the claim is genuine.  I don't begrudge them that - they must also protect themselves.  But once they are satisfied they deliver, often within hours.

"Veronica Hansen - Outsurance Hi All

My cars gearbox packed up, i paid someone who had a new gearbox and he paid a company to install it which he had a relationship with, basically the gearbox that was installed into my car that was stolen and the owner of the stolen Gearbox located my car at the workshop and took it ransom.

After a lot of back and forth with the parties involved i turned to my insurance as the third party that took possession of my vehicle had done so without my knowledge or consent.

I called more to get advise and perhaps chat to a legal person at Outsurance with regards to my Vehicle. After a quick chat i was assigned a Assessor by the name of Veronica Hansen, She was honestly incredible! She went above and beyond in order to assist me, even at the end of the day when this turned out to be a Civil case she still tried to help me wherever she could. I still don't have my vehicle back but i can genuinely say that it was a pleasure to deal with someone who tried 110% to assist and nothing was to big a ask for her!

I went on the app and submit my claim. They send me a note with a breakdown and made sure I understand the options of claiming and loosing my out bonus. I said go ahead I want to claim and they done everything. I did not have to explain what heppened and I did not have to get quotes they got people to phone me and made the appointment... It was just so easy. I do not know what a larger claim would be like but this is my experience for now. AND also I can add that it was all done in a day there was no waiting and not once did I have to check up on my claim. 5 stars for sure.,1,5,6

"Employee Eugene Goosen We had a car accident last Thursday, when I called outsurance I had the pleasure of dealing with a Mr. Eugene Goosen, who not only went over and above the call of duty with assisting us to get towed, but stayed in contact with us each step of the way until we arrived home again, Eugene you are honestly amazing, salt of the earth and the kind of employee and all round person each of us need to have in our lives, thank you so so much, I am so grateful you answered our call that night.

"Excellent claim experience with Outsurance I have had a very well priced Outsurance Policy for my car for may years but have only recently needed to claim on it. I called the number and was helped by a knowledgeable consultant who took me through the claim process verbally and then followed up with an email and claim number. The assessor called me later that day to ask some questions/asked for some pictures of the vehicle and advised I would be informed of the outcome  shortly. As promised the approval came through the next morning and I was then called by the panel beating company to arrange a time to take the car in and Gugulethu (my helpful consultant at Outsurance) called to advise that a car rental company would also call. Following drop off of the car (the car rental car was there waiting for me) between Outsurance, and the panel beater I was kept informed of the progress  of the repair until 4 days later when I was able to collect my car- good as new. The whole process was easy and well organised. The people I dealt with were both courteous and helpful. If the rest of South Africa could be run like this, we would be a number ONE nation. Well done Outsurance.!",1,5,2
"Amazing and patient sales agent who takes the time to make sure you get exactly what you want and need, not what they want to sell. Angie Visage of Outsurance invested a pains-taking (for her) amount of time on us to make sure we understood every aspect of her quotation and that we had the cover that we needed. In so doing she managed to reduce our excesses and save us approx. 30% on our monthly premiums for exactly the same, if not more cover. Thank you to Angie and her supervisor, Cambridge, for spending so much time and care on us, it is greatly appreciated and gives us immense comfort to know we are properly insured.",1,5,10

"Outsurance so honest <div>This guy's are honest, last week I took a quote with them on the same car I have insured with Oakhurst. When they could not match my premium initially I thought they were going to chicken out and I asked for my R500, instead they asked for my non claim proof which I sent. Instead they paid me R1500. Is that not awesome? I will recommend them for their honesty. 
Big up to Outsurance.</div>",1,5,3
Outsurance outstanding (as usual) I have been a happy customer of Outsurance for many many years. Unfortunately I joined the 'retrenchment' party a while ago and Outsurance accommodated me by reviewing my policy schedule and premiums. To top that I had a claim recently as an opportunistic 'burglar' decided to rob my house of all electronics. As usual Outsurance assisted me AGAIN by resolving my claim at world class pace and did not contribute to the additional 'stress' in our daily SA lives. To top this I have received countless telemarketers informing me that they can 'save' money on my insurance premiums. This is just another example of why I will never leave Outsurance. Your customer services from P&G Bryanston that also assisted in sorting out my claim was world class. You guys are the best and you have a customer for life,1,5,2

I have a funeral cover with Outsurance and unfortunately lost my mom 2 weeks ago and had to submit a claim, I spoke to a lady by the name of Trisha Singh who was very helpful, Trisha was so apathetic with me and made me feel that I am not alone in this difficult time and she explained the claim process with me and provided me with her contacts should I need further assistance. After submitting the necessary documentation Outsurance made a payout within 24 hours, after that there was a lady by the name of Lerato or Palesa I cannot remember correctly, who called me to amend the changes on my policy as well as give me the new premium going forward also empathizing with me for my loss. Trisha then called me a couple of days later to check if the payment was made and if all is in order....WOW what an amazing service, OUTSURANCE you have really OUTdone yourselves guys and I am proud and happy to be part of such an organization.

I didn’t have to step foot inside of an office and was covered all within a 2hr period from the time I first spoke to Brandon. I am blown away by his service and how highly he speaks of the company he works for. 

Once again, I am blown away at how efficient and speedy this whole process was!

Good morning, I would love to share my incredible experience received yesterday, Tuesday 4 May from a wonderful, super efficient lady by the name of Kerryn Izatt, Call Centre consultant extraordinaire! Kerryn is NOT just a Call Centre agent, Kerryn is an exceptional asset to Outsurance in every sense of the word! Her Excellent Customer Service far exceeds what the Service Industry is throwing out on a daily basis ! I'm old school and still enjoy human interaction in this fast paced world we live in.
I was assisted with such professionalism, with extreme profound knowledge of the products, her super friendly disposition lends itself to the very environment Kerryn works in, which is not an easy environment at all - servicing sometimes very rude and nasty individuals! The shame be on them! 
Kerryn, I am so grateful to you for your kind assistance and for the way in which you conducted the whole experience! You are a Super Star !! 
Many call centre agents can take a leaf out of Kerryn's book and learn what actual Exceptional Customer Service is all about!!
May Kerryn receive loads of recognition for this call which was recorded and I certainly hope that whomever the ""Big Wigs"" are, sitting in their Ivory Towers, sit up and take note of this diamond they have and award her on her QA ! If you don't, the shame be on you!
Kerryn provided the ""WOW"" factor and I highly commend her!

I have applied for a personal loan at my bank, but it was declined due to me being listed on SIAS Administration.
What is this? I cannot establish ANY form of contact with them, and nobody from OutSurance seems to be able to assist.
My husband passed away and I urgently need money to finalise his estate, but now I must see that I have been blacklisted by this SIAS.
Please respond as a matter of utmost urgency or provide me with the correct contact information.

"Great Service In March 2019 we had a couple of hailstorms which caused my roof to leak and I got water in my lounge ceiling, luckily we noticed it soon enough and made a small hole in the ceiling to drain the water with no visible damage to the ceiling  except for a water mark and the small hole which I made. I recently noticed that my ceiling was sagging and it looked as if the whole thing was going to come down.
I contacted Outsurance and they sent out their assessor to inspect the damage, while the assessor was here I also told that my driveway paving was sinking at the entrance to my garage causing water to dam up and flood my garage every time we had a good rain. The assessor inspected the paving, took measurements and advised me on what should be done to remedy the problem with my paving. He left and told me I would be contacted by Outsurance the same day or the next.
Outsurance approved both claims and paid me out in cash and advised that I should get contractors to do the repairs, this saved me paying any excess.
In January I got quotes for the repairs and appointed contractors who subsequently done the repairs to my satisfaction. The ceiling repair came in slightly over budget and the paving repair was considerably lower. 
So forfeiting my Out Bonus due to the claims I came out with a couple of extra rand which more than covered my Out Bonus and my repairs are done.
One happy client :)",1,5,4
"THANKS OUTsurance I previously shared my frustrations about the situation in the OUTsurance PROMOTION about their R1 500 payment for those qualifying as per their rules.

Very customer-centric, and when other insurance companies were finding reasons not to pay out, Outsurance covered us for the pandemic and paid out.

All round a great company to deal with. ",1,5,1

I have recently logged a claim for a locksmith where by I had an emergency on a Sunday and i required services from a locksmith.

My Bill was R2150.00, and I was entitled to approx R800 refund from my out and about free service, however Cindi went over and beyond to motivate to her case manager upon hearing and emphathisng my situation at home where my small niece was locked in my bedroom and the key broke in the lock.  She managed to get my entire bill paid out and I am truly grateful for her service and passion for assisting her clients.

"Yes , Outsurance paid me for not being able to beat my quote. :)  Honestly I have never heard of a company that pays you for not beating your premium but OUTSURANCE did. 
I always heard on Metro FM daily on the ""request a quote"" ad but I've never really bothered because this sounded like some marketing strategy and promotions that some companies use but we really never have a winner.  . 
But I guess I was wrong because Outsurance did pay R500 into my account for not being able to beat my current premium.  

Thank you to the friendly staff and amazing service i am definitely looking into joining the outsurance family in the near future.

"OUTsurance has OUTstanding service!   I am absolutely impressed with OUTsurance and their friendly, speedy response to my distress call over a weekend.

While moving a TV unit I accidently hit and broke the glass pane of a window that leads to an open veranda.

I logged a claim via their app. It was easy to navigate through.

Within minutes I received a confirmation SMS and within the hour a consultant called me.

I explained what had happened.  I don't have Home Building Insurance but only Home Contents Insurance.  I didn't want my claim to effect my No-Claim-Bonus.
The consultant explained that there is Emergency Cover for accidents/incidents like mine and transferred my call to a friendly and helpful consultant; Nkosinathi.  He continually called while I waited for the glass company to arrive to ensure that I was safe.

Not long after the glass company; Glasfit contacted me and very shortly after the call arrived.  They measured the glass for the window pane and within minutes they had replaced and repaired the broken glass of the window.  I felt safe with the repaired glass pane of the window.

I received a call from Quinton Kruger, a manager of OUTsurance following up on my Emergency Claim.  Super friendly and explained the whole process about the Emergency Cover.  It is an extra feature that OUTsurance have for their clients at no extra cost to a client.  Fantastic cover and service to offer!

I have been a client of OUTsurance for many years and each time I have had an unfortunate incident they are friendly and quick to help and resolve my claims.

I highly recommend OUTsurance for the OUTstanding service in the insurance industry from car to household cover. ",1,5,3

"True to their word R500.00 promo You know insurance companies week in, week out they will send you messages about getting quotes and that their premium will be cheaper than what you are currently paying.

So OUTsurance sent me an sms and that if they can't beat my current premium, they will pay me R500.00 for the quote. 

I replied YES and a consultant called me back, we did the quote and it was double what I am currently paying. 

The process of the claim took place and communication continued, as to the necessary documentation and all. 

Later, they informed me that I qualify for the R500.00 promo, in 2 or 3 working days it was paid to my elected account. 

For that I applaud OUTsurance for being true to their word, thank you. ",1,5,6

They helped me initiate my insurance claim, and the assesors phoned me within 2 minutes of my conversation with Outsurance. Whether the claim is covered or not (depends on the assessment of the issue and whether it was a power surge/load shedding) the efficiency of Outsurance is really impressive, and I am glad my entire insurance portfolio resides with them.",1,5,21

"Thanks Outsurance and Tara Snyders for great service I recently had a burst geyser.  Outsurance were fantastic and in particular their advisor Tara Snyders was fantastic and kept me updated every step of the way.  They did ask for feedback afterwards but there was a glitch and my phone would not allow me to complete the survey, so Tara got a less than positive feedback rating.   She was fabulous and I would rate her as absolutely outstanding.  Outsurance have sure got the client service piece in place.  Their staff are phenomenal, particularly Tara.  Thank you. ",1,5,22

"Extraordinary service  Late last year, I was contacted by Lindo from Outsurance regarding insurance cover. I was looking for cover for my house, house contents, motor vehicles etc and gave him all of the relevant information. 
A short while later, he presented me with a monthly premium that was much lower than my current Insurer and armed with this information, approached my Insurer and they reassessed my premium and reduced the payment significantly.
Having been with my Insurer for some 45 years, I reluctantly passed up on the Outsurance quote.
However, I must state that Lindo's service was outstanding and any follow up dates and times was impeccable and I have no hesitation in recommending him to anyone wanting to deal with a quote from Outsurance

"Outsurance Roadside Assistance - Excellent Service I would like to thank Rachel from the Roadside Assistance team at Outsurance. Rachel was a real star while assisting me. She was calm, very professional and extremely helpful. I was stranded next to the N12 highway with my car heating up, I decided to pull off the side of the road to avoid having the car overheating. I phoned Outsurance Roadside Assistance and Rachel instantly arranged for a local towing company to come to my aid. What impressed me immensely about her is that she did waist any time nor did she hesitate to assist me. She did not ask a lot of unnecessary questions or spent hours confirming details etc. She just jumped into action to resolve my problem and insure me and my passenger's safety. Immediately after hanging up the call, I received two SMS's - 1) With Rachel's name and contact information as well as 2) The details of the tow in company that was on it's way to assist me. 10 Minutes later, The local tow in company pulled up and loaded my vehicle and took me and my passenger home safely. Words can not describe the gratitude I feel for Rachel, and her great service as well as to Outsurance as a company for having had my back in a time of need - NO QUESTIONS ASKED. The only word that comes to mind when I think back is WOW. Keep up the great work, you have a loyal customer for life! ",1,5,1

"compliment What great service from your consultant in the legal department, her name is Abby Fairbank. I was involved in a car accident in 2020 and had to pay an excess of R4700.00 as per my insurance I took. It is very traumatizing being in a  car accident not only financially but psychologically as well especially if you are not in the wrong. Abby Fairbank was there throughout the process in the legal department for me, she kept me updated every month in terms of the follow up for me to claim my excess fee back from the party's insurance. It very rare these days to get people like Abby to provide such good service by communicating regularly with their clients and keeping them informed throughout the process. Today she called me with good news that I will get my money back after 3 days, I was very happy as it is January and we all need finance. Outsurance keep up the good work and Chancha Daydeng..... Senior management from Outsurance please give Abby a Bells !!! Regards, Lungile Kamfer, **********  ",1,5,28

The bike was damaged during the recovery and I lodged a complaint against the service provider. The complaint was assigned to Lelethu Thole who contacted the service provider, who accepted responsibility and agreed to pay for the repairs.
Lelethu followed up with me almost daily throughout the claims process and also afterward to confirm that the service provider had honored the agreement - even going to war for me when the service provider was dragging their heels with payment.

I am grateful to Lelethu and Outsurance for the excellent service in a time when customer service seems to not be a priority anymore!",1,5,2

"Exceptional Care & Reliable A great and amazing short term insurer you can rely on. After paying just one premium and without the car even having the inspection done, my husband had a terrible accident and the car was a write off. At that time I also had insurance with Discovery but was behind on premiums. Discovery did the typical thing of finding a million reasons not to pay.
Outsurance did the opposite, they found solutions for every that stood in their way of paying. Exceptional employees all the way, from the Investigator Charles who gave us expectational care and service, to the claims assessor, finance and legal department.
Outsurance is the number one short term insurer and I will never leave them. I will add more of their covers as soon as my financial status improves. Thank you Outsurance!

What a fantastic experience. In a country where exceptional service seems to be a thing of the past that was certainly not our experience. 

Tess had extensive knowledge of all the products and in the end saved us R1500 off our current service provider and in fact, recieved more cover as well. 

Most enjoyable was her bubbly personality, we had many laughs and she was so relatable.

I would highly recommend Outsurance to anyone looking for better cover at a lower premium.

So grateful and what an enjoyable experience. ",1,5,4
"Outsurance Claims Coordinator  After a traumatic experience of an armed robbery at my home, with my 3 year old son included and ****** of my mum, the last thing I expected was a personal touch from Outsurance using a Claims Coordinator to deal with our claim. Apparently still a pilot project, the claims Coordinator, ms. Fay Khan, is THE Pilot to pilot a project like this. Processing of a trauma of this sort is the most difficult experience us as a family have to endure. Worrying about a claim and adding a monetary value after the loss of life is the last thing we thought of. The consultant dealt with this incident in the most compassionate manner, setting our nerves at ease that the support from Oursurance is and will be there, healing and overcoming our ordeal is the priority we needed to concern ourselves with. 
The idea of not worrying about dealing with a call center agent, having a person hands on who personally visits you, constantly updates you via whatsapp or phone calls regarding processment of your claim is a breath of fresh air. 

I can finally understand the reason for the inception of this kind of project having been through my ordeal and my advice to Outsurance would be to cast it in stone.

I take my hat off to you guys for always pushing the bar higher and setting standards where other insurers have to always play catch up nor show this level empathy to the people they deal with or not. 
Its not just a business for you guys and I applaud you guys for that. ",1,5,2

"Outsurance-Bathandwa  Where do I even start!? Bathandwa id like to send a shout out to you, what an amazing guy you are. You spoke to me for over an hour yesterday, you put my mind at ease and answered every question I had and more! Well done for beating my current car insurance. Super friendly and professional at the same time. Thank you ",1,5,3
"Excellent Service Recently my car was tampered with at a shopping mall in Cape Town. Both front door locks and the ignition was broken. From the minute I called OUTSURANCE to the day I got my car back. The service from OUTSURANCE was EXCELLENT. The Claim Advisor, REGAE MOGAPI was reassuring and extremely helpful. SHE WENT OUT OF HER WAY TO PUT MY MIND AT EASE. The tow truck company was quick to respond and Regae kept me updated constantly. At first I had a bit of a hiccup with the repair company but Regae stepped in and sorted everything out. The car was repaired to my satisfaction and overall the whole experience was a good one. It is seldom we get great service from companies in South Africa, sad but true BUT I will never regret using OUTSURANCE as my insurer. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN REGAE FOR ALL YOUR HELP AND FOR PUTTING MY MIND AT EASE.

"Best insurance in SA goes to Outsurance and Best towing company goes to Warden X Haust and Tyre  On Sunday 29 November 2020, while driving back from a weekend away with the family in Clarens, we hit potholes, despite our attempt to avoid these. This rendered our car unable to drive as the rim had been cracked. I called Outsurance and spoke to Zhander - who was fantastic in arranging a towing company - Warden X Haust and Tyre to aid us. Henk from Warden X Haust and Tyre was fast, speedy and professional. He collected us and our call well under 45 mins and whisked us back to Jhb. Thank you to both Outsurance and Warden X Haust & Tyre for such wonderful service!",1,5,5
"They always there through it all  The claim process was long and unpleasant to a certain extent, but I would really  like to take this time and thank  the outsurance team who supported me through it all and took their time to really make me understand that it was all part of the process and support me and my business through it all....
Their support gave me the confidence and peace during the most difficult time for my business.

I thank you all for everything ❤️❤️❤️",1,5,51

"Melanie Reddy  I would like to compliment Melanie Reddy from outsurance on her professionalism, manners and friendly service. She was absolutely brilliant from the start of the conversation till the end. Even though I didn't end up taking the policy, she remained polite and still offered to give me insight and recommendations  on other policies. if there is a standard to be met in the call center game then  she has met and surpassed that standard. Wish all agents could be like this, then we don't have to cut the call or refuse to answer when we see ""those numbers"" pop up on our phones. Absolutely brilliant Melania, well done and keep it up.",1,5,2
Help at out Thank you too Melanie reddy for her excellent service and her beatiful personality her friendly manner of explaining the whole  proses stay blessed many blessings for the future nd a blessed festive season ,1,5,1
Outstanding Service Thank you to Outsurance for their amazing service. The level of service provided by Herman du Pisani and team was truly remarkable. It is not often that an insurance company provides you with the reassurance that the job will get done however Outsurance did exactly that. ,1,5,3

"Awesome ""OUT"" experience.  Outsurance is just in a space of its own. I have tried other insurance companies, you can't compare them to Outsurance, l had a breakdown yesterday, requested roadside assistance from the app, within seconds (still on the app) a consultant called me informing me that they are sending a tow truck, in 10mins the tow truck arrived. My vehicle was taken to where l wanted. The consultant even later called me to check if l had arrived home safely.
That was quite an ""OUT"" experience. 
Keep up the good work team OUTSURANCE.

Happy Client I am truly so happy with the service I received. Was not an easy case but  Krenashin Govender went out of his way to assist us. I am truly glad I joined Outsurance. They kept me updated all the time. Simply the BEST!,1,5,1
"Michelle Joyce from Outsurance I would like to give my gratitude to the Outsurance Pet Division. 

Michelle Joyce gave me excellent service going above and beyond making sure of facts rather than just giving information.

Her professionalism and friendliness gave me the reassurance that Outsurance for my “babies” is the right choice for my peace of mind.

We live in a bizarre world and people’s thoughts are so divided, but because of Michelle Joyce being so kind and friendly, treating me with so much respect, means so much to me. Michelle actually cares for me as a client and value my needs and love for my “fur babies”. 

Thank you Michelle for making a difference, not only for me, but for everyone you deal with, you are indeed an asset to your Company. I hope every client you deal with, treat you with the same respect you give them.

Its always nice to have a warm feeling to write a review for someone who deserve it.

Kind Regards
Dalene Hattingh

"Great job Outsurance!!! I dropped my phone and the screen got damaged. Outsurance sent people over to repair the screen at my home within 2 days. Two weeks later my phone stopped charging. They assessed if the phone could be repaired, which it couldn't. They made a payment to my account the next day. Fast service...love Outsurance!",1,5,3
"R1500 - PAID INTO MY ACCOUNT Wow, I just got paid R1500 by Outsurance for not being able to match my premium with my Insurance, this thing is real ....Thank you Outsurance, unfortunately I couldn't join you! But you kept your promise.  ",1,5,2
"Amazing service from the Outsurance team. My dad had submitted a claim through the Outsurance mobile app. Not long afterwards he received a call from an agent and the process began. We were assisted by Andrew Smith and his colleague Trisha Singh. Unlike many insurers, Outsurance surely does look for reasons to approve a claim where as other companies instead look for a reason not to payout a claim. My dad wasn't well but Andrew kept calling to check up on his well being and to update us on the progress and in no time the claim was finalized with no inconvenience caused to us. This experience from Outsurance was simply amazing! ",1,5,3

"Alisa Human - TOP EMPLOYER This is for Alisa Human at OUTSurance. All I can say is WOW! She has been super helpful! The changeover from another insurer to OUTSurance was seamless and easy. Unfortunately, I had some bad luck this year (water leakages, smashed screen, scratched car - all in this crazy 2020!), but each claim I gave through to her to escalate was dealt with in record speed and competence. WELL DONE. As long as Alisa Human is at OUTSurance, I will never leave. She is such an asset!",1,5,4
"Outstanding Service Our hot water cylinder started leaking causing damage to the floor and ceiling. We also had a leak in the kitchen and the dishwasher leaked.
Without any hesitation Outsurance arranged for all the damage to be repaired and kept in contact with us through the process. Their staff are great to deal with. Quick respose. Would recommend them to anyone looking for insurance that actually works for you.",1,5,4
"Best Insurer I Have Ever Worked With I must say, I was a bit skeptical joining Outsurance in the beginning. Even the things they were promising sounded too good to be true. But I was very pleasantly surprised at how efficient and professional the insurer was. One of our drivers had a very unfortunate accident on the 31st of October, which resulted in the car being written off. Outsurance was very speedy and helpful with the matter. The claim process was started and finished in about a week with no funny business.

I would especially like to thank a lady called Ma-vie Martin from the claims department. She was phenomenal throughout the whole process and was open to assisting with information even after the claim was completed. Very professional and sympathetic.  The number on her signature is Tel: 27-12 **********, in case you want quick and professional assistance. I truly cannot thank you enough.

If you had any doubts about Outsurance, I would advise you to give them a try. I can almost guarantee they will surprise you. Don't let skepticism stand between you and great service :-).

Thank you Outsurance",1,5,14
"GO OUTSURANCE! I must be honest I was quite skeptical when I joined OUTSURANCE after leaving my previous Insurance that I have been with for quite a few years. I had an unfortunate accident Late on Thursday evening on the 12th of November. I made ONE call. The lady Phumi Banzi was very concerned about my wellbeing knowing that I was stuck alongside the road and she was on the phone with me constantly. The Tow Truck company arrived in a few minutes. 
EVERYDAY I was informed about the progress on my vehicle. There was also a handy app that I downloaded that showed me exactly what the status of my vehicle was. Since I joined Outsurance it was a pleasant experience for me. My broker Ronel Van Eeden gives you courtesy calls throughout the year and she is really on top of her game! She is a real people’s person and also a real asset to your company!  
Thank you OUTSURANCE!

"Excellent service from Outsurance All along I never knew where to compliment Outsurance for their best service. Now that I know this platform, I would like to thank outsurance for their best service I received while claiming for my car that was involved in an accident, and their excellent service received even before, I never had any problem when it comes to making claims or requesting for assistance. They are quick, well organise and reliable. Keep up your good work.",1,5,10
"Thank you Outsurance I had outstanding service from Outsurance. From the moment my car was stolen, until yesterday when the money was paid out, I was kept informed every step of the way.
When another insurer contacted me to insure my new car, I told them that there was not a chance! I am extremely happy with Outsurance and especially Guguletu, who helped me through everything on the phone.",1,5,25
"OutSurance - 10/10 for Customer Service, 10/10 for Payment claim I recently joined OutSurance due to the covid pandemic.  I was with ""X"" insurance company and had to drop my insurance from a fully comprehensive cover to a third party cover as my monthly contribution were too high over lockdown.  
I was approached by an OutSurance broker called George Hanos and he asked if he could quote me.  I got fully comprehensive cover at the same installment i was getting with my ""X"" insurance.  I recently went away and due to bad weather or load shedding my electricity tripped and all the meat and perishables in my fridge and freezer went Stale and Spoilt.  It was a great loss as i had just been away.  I called OutSurance and I was covered for my losses.  This claim was completed telephonically by a very well spoken, well knowledged gentleman called Nish Naidoo.  Once OutSurance received my supporting documents the claim was processed and paid in less than a week.  I am extremely happy with their services and hope to have same in the years to come.  Well Done to Customer Service!",1,5,12

"Chencha daai ding Outsurance kept their promise that if they can't beat my current insurance, they will pay me R500.00, I just received it. This assured me that if an outsurance customer is claiming,  they will definitely pay the claim.",1,5,7
"You always get something out! Thank you Karien Van Der Merwe. You always get something out! When I hadn't claimed for 3 years, I received R 3 000 without any qualms. Whenever I would ask for a reassessment I would be assisted with friendliness and pay less each time. And when it came time to claim after my wife's car was written off, they settled the claim with two weeks. I am especially pleased with Karien Van Der Merwe, she dealt with us with compassion and comprehension. I truly found her to be invested in a positive outcome like she was on our side. I suppose that's the Outsurance difference. ",1,5,5
"Professional & Pleasant Experience I received great service from Outsurance. I could hear water running which I though was the geyser, so I phoned Outsurance and they sent someone out immediately. As it turned out it wasn't the geyser, but the plumber contacted Outsurance and asked for a leak detection company to come out. A little while later the leak detection company was there, identified where the leak was (uner my kitchen cupboards) and sent the report to Outsurance. The next morning the cupboards people were there first thing to remove the cupboards and the plumber started work immediately. The plumbing work was completed the same day and the cupboards were replaced on the Monday. What super service from the claims officers at Outsurance and the companies that they used were very professional, Thank you.",1,5,7
"**********02 Good day,

"Awesome service from OutSurance I have been an OutSurance client for some time now and I have submitted a few claims over the years. Up to now they have not rejected any of my claims. 
I am convinced that they really do look for reasons to pay out a claim as opposed to looking for reasons not to.
Keep this up OutSurance!! You are the best insurance (sorry, OutSurance) company in South Africa. I think I need to move all my policies over to you.",1,5,13

AWESOME SERVIE FROM OUTSURANCE AGAIN We had an unfortunate incident last week whereby my daughter was bumped by somebody whilst taking a walk and fell on her apple watch and it shattered. I immediately phone outsurance after we established that a new watch costs less than to replace the screen. The claim was registered - evidence sent to the claim advisor who contacted me back within 15 minutes after I send the proof. the claim was settled within 30 minutes from registering it - that is why I have been with outsurance for more than 15 years - just the best hassle free service.,1,5,8

"You guys rock my world :) WOW, I'm still smiling 30 minutes later :)

What awesome service from Innocent and his team today. I called in to update my address for my vehicle finance. 
My rate went up with the change - and I was not happy about this, your team thanked me for my loyalty to Outsurance, reduced my premium - to less then what I originally was paying and were just all around very friendly and professional. My line was bad so he called me back three times, until I could hear him!

His last sentence to me was, I hope that we, at Outsurance and yourself have many more years to come of being your service provider, and I replied with service like this - I will never leave! And you know what? I never will leave!
I have always had great service from Outsurance and it has always been a pleasure dealing with your employees! I wish I had joined years ago!!! But today you guys went the extra mile for me, again, and I greatly appreciate it, as always.

Keep up the awesome work team Outsurance and I must also say, over the covid lockdown, you gave me 10% off my insurance on your own accord, I didn't ask for it - but you offered it to me - and you were the only company that is a service provider to me that did so, I appreciated that too, so thanks for that one as well!

Its the little things like this that people remember you for in the future. You proved to me that day - that you stood out above the rest, while others were putting costs up due to covid, you dropped yours when times were tough for you too, because of this, I will always be a proud Outsurance client and will recommend you to everyone!

Please give ourselves at Outsurance, and Innocent and his team, a pat on the back! You all deserve one :) 

Your happiest client!

I used the roadside assistance button on their app today and even after my Truecaller app cut their call to me short, they called back and even double checked later that everything was fine.

"Impeccable service from Outsurance! I would really like to thank Outsurance for their impeccable service as well as Eben Nel who drove me to Pongola and Chris Barnard for taking the time to drive 5 hours to meet us. I was very sceptical about going as I have never been to Pongola and I thought it would be an informal settlement in the middle of nowhere. 

When Eben and I arrived at Amber Jetz guest house (which was amazing as it had such a relaxing atmosphere, great choice Chris!), I felt more comfortable as I saw that it was far from what I thought Pongola was. We met with Chris Barnard and I must say both have impeccable knowledge about the industry. I was so inspired and motivated to achieve their level in life knowledge and career wise. 

They are two of thee most professional people I have ever met and if I ever have a claim again, I hope it's these two men that are appionted on the claim.",1,5,5
"OUTSURANCE CARES! I am in AWE  with the IMPRESSIVE AND AMAZING SERVICE I regularly receive from OUTSURANCE!!!

I have been a client for close to 2 years and I feel like that is a very short relationship but the way I AM SO HAPPY IT FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME.

The consultants are so professional, friendly and understanding which proves they are trained well and know the value and purpose of the company very well. 
They are so empathetic when you're in a situation and they ensure that your queries are dealt with URGENCY.
If I could write my experience in a book about great customer service from OUTSURANCE,  I would.
I have had major car problems and everytime my car broke down and I call them,the call centre is always timely and ready to assist and send HELP as soon as possible and they keep calling to check up on you while you wait unlike many call centers where you're transferred from pillar to post and you get put on hold for hours.

Their latest SMART DRIVE PROGRAM is just out of this world. It saved me a major R500 and I don't think that is a reward I would've gotten anywhere else for just being a good driver.
I AM SO PLEASED to be an OUTSURANCE CLIENT and am so glad I made just the right decision choosing them. THEY SURPASS MY EXPECTATIONS ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!

Outsurance high level of service delivery I had a little mishap when parking my new car in my garage.  I accidentally bumped the front bumper and damaged the parking assist sensor.  Very distraught I phoned Outsurance and my mood changed when helped by a super friendly and knowledgeable staff member.  Within minutes I received a claim number with details of the repairer where I should take my car.  Every step of the way I was kept up to date with developments.  Never encountered this high level of client service anywhere else.  Super grateful to them for making a an accident bearable,1,5,7
"ONE GRATEFUL SMALL BUSINESS OWNER!! THANK YOU OUTSURANCE!! I have small business cover with Outsurance. Since lockdown, like every other SME, have been struggling to sustain our business. In these tough times its easy to contemplate taking a gamble by cancelling insurances and cover that we know is critical to our business. Fortunately we didn't. We are a fibre company and received work in the Vaalpark area. One of my company vehicles broke down on site. I had a mechanic sent out and discovered it was a major mechanical problem. I contacted Outsurance to have my vehicle towed back to my offices in Roodepoort. It was a WOW from the time of calling them. Zandre called me and sent me the details of the towing company. From there on it was constant follow up from him and the towing company until the vehicle was dropped off at my offices. The best part was that I did not pay anything as this formed part of my 2 free breakdowns for the year. That did not change the standard of service. In these tough times I would like to say to Outsance and Zandre, THE SERVICE AND CARE IS AWESOME....THANK YOU!!! From One Grateful Small Business Owner.",1,5,4
"OUTSURANCE ROCKS1 When my cellphone was lost, I did not even wait a week for a new one.

Integrity They called me offering a quote fir my car insurance. Ultimately I they’re quote was more expensive than my current car insurance but I must say they’re offerings were better than my current. But I must commend them on their integrity. I didn’t even request the R500 as advertised but they offered it to me. They even went to the extent of calling to verify my banking details. I must say I’m impressed with the integrity. I hopefully will eventually take the their insurance when I can afford it or at the end of the way when they quote me again. ,1,5,6
"Outsurance are everything they claim ""on the box"" We have our house contents insured with Outsurance and our house through Nedbank. We had a fire in our garage and contacted Nedbank first on 30 Sep so as to get the (relatively minor) structural damage repaired. We only submitted our claim for the various contents damaged in the fire to Outsurance on 8 Oct. 

I have to confess I'd been sceptical as to whether Outsurance would live up to their claims but I swallow my words - they are everything it ""says on the box"" :-))

They speedily addressed and resolved the claim and we have already been paid out (by which I mean the money has already taken the few days it takes to ""clear"" in our bank account). I am very impressed with Outsurance and their affiliated service providers.

Nedbank, meantime, are still messing us around... You can read about that experience here: https://bit.ly/3m5TVAL",1,5,24

Up to now I haven't had a bad experience.",1,5,7
"Wonderful service! I would like to compliment Wesley Van Diggelen, Claims Advisor at Outsurance on his superb assistance with a claim we had on our vehicle policy recently. Under normal circumstances it is difficult enough to deal with a call centre, and with the COVID pandemic it’s even more of a nightmare. Wesley gave his direct contact details for the duration of the claim and followed up all the way through, making it a seamless experience from start to finish. Rare to find these days. Thank-you Wesley and Outsurance!",1,5,15

"Outsurance  After many years of being with 1st for Women, talking about 20yrs, my installments kept on going higher, even though I am over 50 and have never caused an accident.
There have been 3 claims, not of my fault. 
So I made the decision to switch to Outsurance. The sales consultant convinced me to take a motor plan just under R70 and still my premium was R500 cheaper.
Needless to say,, my car cut out due to rats chewing the engine wires......R65 000 quote. 
I took a chance and phoned Outsurance, and was fully covered within 4 days.

I was very impressed at how professional and efficient they were.

"Excellent Service from Cindy Masindi  Cindy Masindi is a true Gem! She was extremely friendly. She kept the quoting process flow very easy and light, even adding in some humour to our conversation. She had the patience of an angel with my 2 year old screaming in the background, throwing a tantrum every 5mins. She heard my concerns about finances as a single mother and exceeded my expectations over and above with an affordable premium for both my car & contents. I could not praise her enough and will be spreading the word far and wide on how great my experience with OUTsurance was! Hope Cindy Masindi will be up for the next available managers position, as this lady deserves a pay increase!",1,5,15

"Excellent and responsive service from Outsurance Claims Department I had the pleasure of dealing with Mr. Brett Kimmie in the Outsurance claims department after our business vehicle was involved in quite a serious accident on Monday evening. I contacted Outsurance on Wednesday morning and they promised that a Claims Department rep would contact me within an hour. Brett called me about an hour later and took all the details he needed to process things further. He gave me the opportunity to send further details to him via email, which I did. I explained that we needed the results of their assessor's report urgently so that we could decide whether we need to purchase another vehicle, since it was a vehicle that our small installation team depended on for ongoing projects. He promised that he would do his best. On Wednesday afternoon at about 15h30, he phoned me with the assessor's report and called me again on Thursday morning to notify me of the amount that would be paid out on the claim before passing on the claim to the next relevant department. I told him how much we appreciated his quick service and responsiveness to our situation. Thanks so much Brett:-)

"BEST SERVICE EVER I have been with Outsurance since 2004. We had a few claims, but that was over a long period. Every time there were not any problems. Claims were handle fast and professionally. But in a period of two weeks we had 4 bad experiences. Cell phone was stolen, car accident, broken windscreen, house break-in. I was totally stressed out. Four claims in a 2 week period. Will any insurance company pay for all the claims? I was on holiday and the cell phone reception was very bad. They were patient and did not give up trying to get hold of me. They did not only pay for everything, they were very understanding. I worked with the following persons during the claim process (Ataniel Thaver, Iris Behariral, Nolwazi Mthenjane and Bradley Chetty).  I want to give you all a big THANK YOU for changing a bad experience into an easy solution",1,5,23

"Pleasantly Surprised! Impressed 2 the max!

So yesterday morning I had an embarrassing accident at home, I walked with my head buried in my phone and slipped on a loose rug in the living room, I accidentally knocked over my tv, laptop and cellphone and fell on it. 
I thought about not claiming from my insurance as I'm a brand new client with them, however the damage was a bit high and I decided to submit a claim last night. 
After reading some reviews on Hello Peter and Facebook, I was certain that my claim advisor would be difficult and try and find reasons not to submit / approve my claim, however, I couldn't be more wrong. The claims adviser assigned to my claim was Ataniel Thaver, this morning he phoned me early, asked details about my claim and the damage and he agreed to update me on my claim status shortly, all while being friendly and professional. 
Not once did he mention that I'm a new client and not once did he try to change my mind on not claiming.
So after reading all the negative remarks and comments of OUTsurance on Facebook and Hello Peter, I decided the company as well as Ataniel deserves a shout-out!
I hope that we will be walking a long road together and that you will be my insurance provider for many years to come!
Keep up the great work guys!
Gerhard Giliomee",1,5,3

"Thank you Outsurance I would like to give a big compliment to Outsurance. I used to insure my vehicles with a company that was recently incorporated into Outsurance. When Outsurance contacted me with this news and to confirm my details we found I was still paying premiums on a vehicle I sold in 2015. Without any prompting from me they repaid all the premiums once I had sent them proof of change of ownership. Strictly speaking this was not really their responsibility since previously I was not insured with them, and it could be argued that I should have checked myself. A big thanks to the people who dealt with me; Jessica Matlou, Fikile Mlauzi and Carla Crous.",1,5,2

The only reason why i decided to use Outsurance is because of the customer care experience Tshepiso Lefakane has given me.

Thanks again Tshepiso Lefakane. Outsurance will only grow with staff like her.",1,5,20

"Outstanding Service!!! My geyser element gave up on a late afternoon on 16th June 2020, a cold public holiday. I contacted Outsurance and they had the issue fully resolved within 3 hours after I made the initial call. The service from Simphiwe Mbendani was outstanding. Simphiwe called constantly to check on progress and to check if the Service Provider had arrived and done what needed to be done. Nathi Khuzwayo was also excellent in keeping in touch with me. They deserve a lot of praise for the service they provided. I was even impressed that Jason Moodley followed up later that evening to check if all was done to my satisfaction. I assume it was a shift change so Jason picked up the call. All round, it was outstanding service from the whole team.

Kudos ... Well done to you all !!!",1,5,17

Again Outsurance and Eulanda Buthelezi have helped me to the highest degree Once again I have received the most outstanding service from Outsurance.  My car was stolen on Thursday and I reported the incident to Outsurance and my consultant Eulanda Buthelezi attended to everything on my behalf and was able to advise me of a settlement figure on the following Monday.  Eulanda was efficient and polite to the highest degree which is very hard to find these days.  I am 61 years old and all of this was extremely traumatic.  The one area where all the problems disappeared was that of being able to purchase another little car which is so vital nowadays.  I can and will always recommend Outsurance as the preferred service provider.  They are professional and their staff are a manifestation of the name that carries a lot of credibility as the number one insurance company of choice in South Africa today.  Thank you for being a call away and a friend when things become rough and taking the stress and working with it in my best interest.  I am very grateful and thank you Eulanda for being a true friend.,1,5,21

I was kept informed all the time about the workmanship, I was very impressed with workmanship and workers, they were very respectful, efficient, and the worked very fast.

"Outsurance and Tom Mashiloane To Whomever may read this. 

I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that I try to avoid sales calls from companies in general. However, yesterday I had sometime and I decided ""Why not take it"" and booyy oh boyy was I glad I did.

I had the great honor of speaking to Tom Mashiloane. I have never had the pleasure of speaking to a consultant that was so genuine, honest, understanding and motivated. I work in a call center related environment myself and I honestly wish we had a Tom or 20 of him! Pretty sure he could have sold ice bags if I lived in Alaska! Tom and I both agreed that we would definitely pay a bit more for better service!

Outsurance, I would like to add. I think you guys have the best products, anything I could think of was already included in the protection with you guys and it was not even additional protection, it was included in the policy with no extra fees! I now see why you are the best insurance company out there by far!

Last note, perhaps a manager or senior of Tom's will read this. He is by far an exceptional human being and with the added benefit of the gift of the Gab ( the ability to speak easily and confidently in a way that makes people want to listen to you and believe you) give that man a bells, applause .. raise or even a promotion... or simply just acknowledge him!

"Service over and above! I have been a happy client of Outsurance for many years now. That said, in support of a friend, I cancelled my policy – with my cover coming to an end in July. I had received my OutBonus last month. As luck would have it, despite a single claim some 5 years back – my 10 year old dropped his iPad at home, and broke his screen. I was VERY sceptical that Outsurance would cover my claim, especially since I was only their client until the end of this month.

Added to this, my Out-and-About did not list the iPad in question, AND I was not covered for it under household items. Despite all of that, the fantastic Busi Buthelezi said she would make an enquiry with management. Imagine my surprise when, given my low claim history, they agreed to make a plan. A quote was generated on what I would have paid, were the iPad to have been registered under Out-and-About, with a very reasonable excess payment being required. This was yesterday. Today,  I was already contacted by the provider who will repair the iPad, with collection happening tomorrow. 

This is truly above and beyond what was required – and I am mightily impressed. Thanks to Busi and Outsurance. If I ever need a new insurer again, I won' think twice in returning to Outsurance!",1,5,1

"AMAZING service from  Bridget Serite @  Outsurance!! Wow! I have been with Outsurance for a few years and I recently sold my vehicle and called in to cancel my current policy. I requested a quote for a new vehicle and I was forwarded to the most amazing advisor on the planet. Bridget Serite handled my request and it was an absolute pleasure dealing with such a knowledge and professional advisor! Bridget was patient and kept following up while I was shopping around for vehicles and happily assisted me throughout the process. 

Please @Outsurance - Give Bridget a Shoutout for her amazing service. She is a real asset to your organization!

We often so quick to complain and not so quick to take a few minutes to write something positive. I noticed this is not the first positive review on this platform directed to Bridget Serite so I’m guessing there are tons of people that received excellent service from her. 

Thanks,

"Brilliant insurance customer service  I've heard a lot of scary stories about how difficult it was to work with Outsurance. All these stories I heard AFTER I took all my insurances with them. 

On Tuesday 14th of July - during loadshedding while on lockdown at night-  just the worst possible time in my opinion, thieves broke into my yard! They butchered my electric fence and only managed to steal all the copper water pipes from the outside. By the time we went to check why our alarm system tripped, the thieves were gone and water was gushing out from the main water pipe. The damage was bad and the thieves had damaged the water pipes that go underground. It was too deep for us to fix and which plumper will come out at that time without charging an arm and a leg? Plus our home security was destroyed. It was so scary!

Having never had home insurance before,  calling them was a last resort. I spoke to a wonderful lady by the name of Avril Hoskins, who told me not to worry - explained the procedure and dispatched a plumber. 

I could feel the burden of sorting out everything just lift as i spoke to her. She made me laugh, kept telling me not to worry and called me back ever so often - to check on the progress of the plumber. The plumber had arrived earlier than estimated. She really was amazing.  Between Avril and Benny's Plumbers we were able to rest a bit. 

Thank you so much to Avril, as far as she was she really did manage to hold my hand.

"Great Service from OUTsurance's Rethabile  Just had a quote with Rethabile from OUTsurance and I easily feel compelled to give her a compliment because she was very human, genuine, friendly and professional.
She balanced provision of regulated information, fine print, and service features and benefits so well that the whole conversation felt like an interaction with a very knowledgeable friend. And she listens - she does not ask those clumsy, irritating and interruptive questions that force you to repeat yourself unnecessarily. 

I think if you want to try OUTsurance it's better you try it with a pleasurable sales conversation that Rethabile can give so call OUTsurance and ask for Rethabile.

"Outsurance paid R1 500, as heir Ad says. I was becoming irritated with the Outsurance Ads for R500 for not giving a better quotation and R1 000 for a no claim for 3 years with the same insurer.
So I tested them last week. I sent the SMS.  They responded the same day.  Naomi Scott was very knowlegable and professional giving me the quotation.  My present Insurance is better than theirs.  I sent through my Policy and the payment to me was done very professionaly by Lethabo Masoga.
I received R1 500 in my account in 3 days.  I am very impressed.  They are true to their word.
My wife's car is insured with Outsurance and in Swptember 2017 they paid over R33 000 for hail damage - no hassles.
Needless to say, I enjoy their ad now.",1,5,4

"5 Star Outsurance Service What an incredible experience. During the lockdown my car battery died and I had Help@Out send someone to jump start. All was good, until the next day the battery had died once again. It was determined that a new battery was needed.  Usually this sort of 'wear and tear' is for one's own account, but Outsurance informed me that they had introduced a scheme that covers the cost of the battery (I assume that this scheme was introduced to help South Africans during the Coronavirus lockdown).  Thanks to Mella the consultant who assisted, and to Outsurance as a model of what a service company SHOULD be. I have been with Outsurance for 15 years, and will certainly not be going anywhere else.",1,5,1

We are very thankful to the two ladies on their optimal performance, professionalism, efficiency and excellence in their work, giving their maximum effort to ensure that they do not leave without attending in detail. At the beginning and during the bond application process, a lot of paperwork was highly needed in so much that we had to endure and submit as per their request. To make our life easier, they kept on explaining the need for them, with Ms Wilson encouraging us and ensuring that we submit all the relevant documentation. Both ladies never gave up on us even though, on some days, we unintentionally delayed submitting  some of the documents. When the documents were ready for submission Ms Matthysen submitted our application, and all the banks declined our application. Ms Sue Wilson and Ms Tracy Matthysen, shared their valuable advice on financial control to avoid the unnecessary expenditures.

I don’t think there are two better loan consultants for Ooba in the whole world.  I don’t have enough words to praise the above two Ooba representatives on a job well done.

A never say die attitude, extremely professional, polite, and well-informed in their jobs.  Before you ask they’re already two steps ahead, they know everything there is to know about bonds, and a little more.

I want to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciated working with you in applying for my last three mortgages.  Your organizational skills made this process run so smoothly, you had all my previous information on record, which made it so easy for me.

I love my new home; you really are superheroes.

"Francois Ellis and Hester Delport- 10star service As first time buyers the task of getting finance for a house was completely out of our elements. Francois Ellis and Hester Delport were absolutely amazing, their service was excellent, always returned our calls, answered our questions with such insight, timeous responses to our emails. They even went as far as to negotiate discount on our transfer and attorney fees. We received the excellent interest rates from the banks due to their phenomenal negotiation skills. Although the seller was not honest with us on the sale and we did not ultimately get to purchase the house, I feel that Francois and Hester deserves praise for there efforts. Once we have worked through the shock of losing the house and we are ready to go at it again, we will certainly work with Francois and team again. Thank you guys.",1,5,1

I was blessed to have had Mrs ****samy work on my pre approval, as well as securing my home loan.

"Bond approved and Excellent service from Karen Martin We would like to thank Karen Martin for her excellent service from Ooba homeloans. We first contacted Karen in 2021 for pre-bond qualification. She submitted our documents to the banks and the results were not good. But then Karen assured us that with some financial adjustments and discipline we will pull through and she encouraged us to give it another shot after 3-6 months. A couple of months later and that was May 2022 we submitted our documents again for pre-qualification and the results came back positive and we were awarded with the certificate within a week. 

Fast forward to June 2022, we contacted her again with an Offer to purchase contract and she did not waste anytime in making sure that things move faster. She literally secured a bond for us within 4 days and on top of that she negotiated on our behalf with the bank to revise their interest rate and the bank sure did so in our favor. My wife and I are amazed of how quick and effective Karen Martin is with her work. 

We are so grateful of her service and the advice she gave us when things were not looking good last year. What we got from this experience was more than just securing and approval of the bond, we also got some financial advice that improved our financial discipline.

Karen is very professional; always ready to listen, help and give support. She takes pride in her work and would make sure that the client is clear of everything before moving to the next phase. At every stage she communicates and provides updates with all developments.

Thank you Karen Martin for such an excellent service and making our dream of owning a home a reality.",1,5,1

"Splendid Service Owning a property in South Africa is arguably a huge mountain to climb. When you see the word ""Home loan Approved"", you just know that this changes your life for good!

Great - shout out to the following Ooba staff, Richard Ndzeku, Elaine Adams and Tracy Visagie. Y'll hold a special place in our hearts (I & my beautiful wife) for an excellent and exceptional service you offered to make our dream of owning a property comes true. On a lighter note, I said to Elaine she would be our superwoman to get us 100% home loan. She laughed and promised nothing but to serve us at her best abilities.

Her best abilities turned out to be our ""superwoman""—100% home loan was delivered. This review is probably insufficient to express our gratitude, currently many things don't look great for SA but these three individuals brought hope and that there's light at the end of the  tunnel!

"Carol Curtin From Ooba Homeloans is the very Best ! If anyone is looking to secure a homeloan, contacting Carol Curtin from Ooba is definitely the way to go. She has an excellent work ethic and an incredibly  positive ""can do"" attitude. I am self employed which makes getting a homeloan quite tricky. Anyone who has been through this process knows that the the amount of paperwork and information needed is rather daunting, however Carol helped me through the entire process from start to finish and meticulously gathered all documents and information needed to submit my application. She responded to my emails and messages immediately and worked tirelessly to make sure I got the best possible offer from the banks,  which in my case turned out to be Standard Bank. 
 Buying a home can be an emotional experience and Carol really goes above and beyond what is called for - she is not just doing a job - she is invested in the outcome for her clients and is incredibly supportive, friendly and encouraging all the way through the process. I cannot recommend Carol and Ooba Homeloans highly enough. Carol is a brilliant property finance specialist and Ooba  is fantastic!",1,5,3

I was previously using one of Oobas competitors for my bond application process. Their service was shocking so I eventually decided to give Ooba a go. 

I have no words to express my gratitude for the care given to me by Richard Ndzeku. 

Richard treated me like a VIP customer from my very first interaction with him and he called me every day with updates.

I have never experienced such hand on service. 

I will certainly be inviting Richard to pop a bottle of champers with me once I move into my new home.

We were advised to see Jay Govender from the OOBA Pietermaritzburg office to check on affordability & get the best bank deal. We quickly realised that Jay was a true professional and her knowledge and banking experience was formidable. She guided us through the process & got the best deal. Once the plot was registered, we applied for a building loan and again, it was a smooth and financial sound affair. We look forward to living our golden years in a home that OOBA negotiated with the banks!",1,5,2

"Fantastic Service <div>My husband and I were busy house hunting and dreaded the fact that there would be alot of hassles and paperwork that goes with it as soon as we found a house we would like to call home.  Long story short we found a fitting new home we were interested in. This is where Charlene Viljoen came into our wonderful story, not just did she help us but she went out of her way to make the whole process for us so much easier and actually enjoyable. She really cares for her clients and helped us all the way from the small nitty gritty bits to all the hard work and research to find us the best deal on the bond. We would recommend her to anyone who is interested in buying a new home. She managed to obtain packages from all the leading banks in South Africa to find us the best deal with regards to the interest rates and terms and conditions. 
We really don't want to buy another house in the near future but if we do I will definitely make use of her friendly services again.</div>",1,5,1

"OOBA Home Loans - Awesomely Outstanding Service from Shireen Fenwick Its a truly sad fact - one that we have to live with.  Generally, the service industry in South Africa, across the board is truly pathetic. The first huge setback is that your initial contact necessitates having to go through some kind of automated service, and eventually when you do speak to someone - they just don't care or just don't know.

BUT WAIT, here comes Shireen Fenwick, from OOBA - and she turns this perception on its head, with her unbelievably awesome service. Man I have never experienced service like I had from her. From day1, she was an absolute professional and worked with a rare kind of dedication - to the extent of sending me emails very late at night - keeping me in the loop all the time.

In short, South Africa needs more people of her calibre, who always put the clients needs first. I mean the process of obtaining the home loan was was speedily concluded without us having to stress about anything. As a matter of fact we did nothing but fill in a questionnaire. And the cherry on the top - Shireen even negotiated a discount with the transferring attorneys!!!",1,5,2

"A very satisfying job done I'd like to publicly express my thanks and to recognise superior service!
From the first encounter with the Sales Representative Johan (friendly, knowledgeable and very thorough in explaining the process and patient in allowing me time to consider my options. He also prepared an itemised quotation so I could evaluate where to allocate my budget, although in the end I actually contracted Elite for the entire job)...
The team that came to work on my property was also polite, friendly and extremely attentive to small details. They were ably lead by Teamleader Weston and executed their various tasks in a cheerful and highly efficient manner. What struck me as being commendable was the meticulous way they cleaned up after themselves, and this reduced the impact and chaos to the home in a four day job cycle.

I'm left with a feeling of satisfaction in the work done, the finished results look great and I'm extremely confident that this will be a good investment for the maintenance of my property.

A pleasure to find old fashioned quality, service and pride of workmanship.
Bravo!",1,5,3

"Very bad after sales service I would just like to mention this company for doing snake business. They let you sign a loan contract although you know nothing about trading give you a half an our training and never see them AGAIN.M C promise you that you can pay back the loan within the next 2 months. That is just how simple it is and if our not capable or don't have the 5 min every day they would hook you up with a experienced trader to help you pay the bond back.
All of this is promised to me and I've lerned myself after the 3 month to start a trade which went very well on the demo but as soon as you use their signals you are paying for cause that's what I'm getting from them you are losing big money. Which I can proof. M.C. Is not answering his phone 
Uan are to busy don't call back and I'm paying my bond lekke ne money they've already received 2 months ago
Been to n experd yesterday and he says I need about 3 months good training before thinking of it to get on the live account. This is how mutch I know he says. which leaves me with another R6000 down the Drain",1,5,2

"Goeie Profesionele Trading Kursus en Coaching wat iets werd is!!! Hallo Francois, baie dankie vir die trades vandag. Ek het meer as 320 dollar wins gemaak en op my account size is dit amper 30%. Ek was so down hierdie laaste 2 weke. Dit was regtig nie goeie trading weke vir my. Ek het my eie trades gedoen en was nie suksesvol. Ek het my account gekrimp met meer as 20%. As n mens nuut is dan is jy baie hard op jouself en ek het my eie vermoëns bevraagteken. Behalwe julle kurses het ek ook het ek nog 'n  ander Suid Afrikaanse online collage se kursus gedoen, ek het in die 3 maande wat ek trade amper 20 boeke oor trading gelees. Ek het nooit as trading gedink as n voltydse beroep. Ek is nou 49, ek is van 1996 in besigheid, maar wat ek gedink het sal n lekker ekstra wees begin nou vir my lyk na n besigheid waarmee ek kan aangaan vir baie jare. Ek het my eie trades ook gedoen vandag, een op die support en resistance strategie en een op die wave tracker strategie. Al twee het uitgewerk. So dit het ook my selfvertroue geboost. 

Ek het vir Uan die aand gesê dat ek wil change na julle Online Trading Collage skuif want dit lyk beter, en ek was reg. Die ander Suid Afrikaanse Online collage leer wel al die basics maar hulle leer mens nie hoe om dit toe te pas. Ek was n paar keer in hulle trading room en met alle respek dit is n grap - ek kannie dink hoe mens iets kan leer daar behalwe Monkey see Monkey do. Hulle beantwoord ook nie n mens se vra nie. Ek het Meganiese Ingenieurswese geswot en dit is hoe my brein werk. As ek verstaan hoekom n persoon iets doen dan kan ek dit toepas, kennis is net iets werd as jy dit jou eie maak. Dit is so die stock market is nie predictable nie maar, 'n goeie trader het n edge want daar is patrone wat herhaal. Daar is dinge wat jy nie kan beheer en dan is daar dinge wat jy kan, so jou coaching leer my om vir die edge te soek, en laaste die ander Suid Afrikaanse Online Collage  leer mens nie naastenby genoeg oor risk management en psychology van trading en dit is in my oë amper die belangrikste. Henry Ford het gesê, jy hoef nie alles te weet nie, maar jou omring met mense wat wel doen. Julle doen moeite en dit maak die Verskil, Dankie Francois du Plessis en Uan Oosthuizen.",1,5,11

"Excellent Service from Uan and his Team Great service from Uan and his team, Started a couple of months ago and had enough patience with my hectic work and travel schedule to keep me informed and in the loop. Once I was ready and had some free time Uan wasted no time at all to clear his schedule. He got me set up, provided training and answered all of my questions that I had.

Can't wait to see how this evolves and to be a part of the team.",1,5,1
"From zero to Hero Lets start with the bad. I've been in trading for 4 years now. I've been hustled out of thousands in an attempt to obtain knowledge and better my trading. After just 3 Months of attending the coaching sessions with Franscois, Heinrich and Uan. I'm proud to announce that I've been consistently profitable almost everyday. I've grown my account everyday with atleast 10%.so much so that my overall acc has grown by 50%. All because of the coaching from these chaps. After 4 years of just losing money, the wisdom from these guys have turned it all around and in 3 months I've made more than I have in 4 years.

I'd like to add to those reading this. If you're worried about having a small account. Don't worry. I started with 2000 and by following their teachings only lost or loose 3% if a trade doesn't work out for me. Again thank you to Francois, Heinrich, Uan and Damian. To Marika and Caroline, thank you too for sometimes just calling to find out how am I doing and how is the trading. To Mr Oosthuizen I'd also like to say a word of gratitude. Never have I heard of a CEO that personally listens to his smallest clients. May Gods richest blessing rain down on all of you and as always stated. May the pips be with you",1,5,3

They helped me make R110 in only 3 minutes on my very FIRST TRADE. This is a company everyone must think about joining, no wait THEY JUST MUST JOIN! You won't regret it. From the training to the people working for this company and just everything is exceptional! Yet again thanks Uan and Damian. I'm excited to walk this path with you, you are a gift send from ABOVE just for me. I really believe no one would have been able to do a better job than you guys.

"""Sceptism meets loadshedding. Ignite."" We were met with huge uncer*****y, one could actually give this review a caption reading ""sceptism"". Uan and Damien really impressed us. This is a English and an Afrikaner married so it takes a set of serious specialised skill to change the dimension. The 1st session was exciting, to the point, captivating and precise. They are pleasant, friendly and in there place. If there was a marketing skill we definately missed it this time. They are very insightful and good company. Their holistic interest in the clients life brings a homely and sincere feel to the meeting. They never once showed any signs of irritability , frustration or (taking the distance into account they travelled to meet with us) tiredness. They were focused and the most admiring quality they have is being humble. They work with precision, accurate information and kindness. We thank them for their out of the box creativity - through loads heading -. We are extremely excited for the next few months.",1,5,1

From the initial sales call where Sherwin the sales agent came to my house and explained everything to me, to the second home visit from Ernst the Support and Training coach who loaded everything on my PC and Phone, took his time (almost 2 hours) to go through everything step by step and assisted me in doing a few trades.

Very Professional service thus far and i'm exited for the new experience of Forex Trading.

I highly recommend the Diversit-e Smart Trading college.

"Trading with confidence My neighbor Anne introduced me to Diversit-e trading college and explained to me what the company is about. Listening for a while I found I wanted to find out more. Anne introduced me to her boss, who was easy to understand with his overview with trading and backup support  and financial advise. I decided to invest a small amount at that time and am sure I will see dividends in time. 
I have been trading for six months now and am excited for the future as I have seen that any problem I've have is not a problem for Diversit-e who have shown me that they thrive on delivering a service to their clients,even after hours. I  realise now that going with Diversit-e was one of the best decisions I have made concerning money and my personnel portfolio outlook.",1,5,1

Ek sal ook dus die doodgewone hedendaagse mens aanbeveel by Diversit-e Smart Trade College, want hulle is excellent.",1,5,1

I have seen so many presentations, so many companies that treat you like a number, they just want what's best for them, I have seen so many presentations and tried software programmes that just didn't work, didn't do what they said, didn't deliver on what was promised. Diversit-e Smart Trade College helped me, they guided me, took my hand and was there with me every step of the way! I would recommend them to everyone I know, this is the best way forward.

Heinrich was very willing to help me and come and give me training I need regarding the platform at my home in Witbank. Even on the short notice of time he help me very good.

Then training session was very helpful and much understanding to me. Heinrich did know what he was talking about and help me very carefully. He ask me if we can make a video I told him I am very camera shy. He said no problem he understand.

I am really feeling good today and looking forward to see how Diversit-e is going to help me in the times ahead.",1,5,1

"🙂 Best service for unpredictable Financial Times. The  only reason I am giving a 5 star rating is because Marina Basson helped me instantly. 
When I started with these guys I has just been retrenched so I fool-proofed myself from being blacklisted. So I went through the procedure and signed up but ended up paying my debts off sooner than expected. My biggest issue is that my portfolio manager at the time didn’t do a great job at following up and updating me on time so that was my only struggle. But I reached out to them again via their WhatsApp number which they put online and they connected me with a Marina who has resolved my issue and cleared my name in less that 24 hours of me complaining.",1,5,2

"Great service I have been with DC Experts for 3 years and their service is great to a point where the agents are very helpful and considerate when it comes to their clients 

I remember some time this year there was a problem with payments to salaries and I phoned DC Experts to explain the matter and they were very understanding and told me as soon as it is sorted out they will give me time, fortunately later in the day we got paid plus they even have a WhatsApp contact to make it more convenient to us as clients 

I am very happy with their service and I would recommend anyone who needs assistance to them.

Even today I got a phone call from Faseeg informing me how far I am with my payments even advising me regarding payments",1,5,1

"Quality Service and Support I would like to give a 5star rating to DC experts.  My journey with them has been one for the books as my advisor and consultant, Babalwa Ntsondwa can give testimony too. Many times during this process I was frustrated and wanted to give up. Through all this they have supported me made some things clear that I didn't understand and have given feedback pet my requests no matter how often I asked the same questions. 
I will recommend your services and people that find themselves in the unfortunate position I was. Hopefully never to return again. But your management of fund distribution for my debt has been well organized and good.

To Babalwa Ntsondwa thank you for putting up with me. My five stars and positive review goes out to you. I hope the conclusion to this relationship and business affair will go smooth and satisfactory. I only have one payment left. I'm looking forward to hearing from you to conclude. 
If you looking for help. DC EXPERTS has the human factor that you need to get you through the management of bad debt and the consolidation thereof will be done with humanity, understanding and compassion for the modern and somewhat challenging life we live in today 

Thank you 😊",1,5,4

We are still receiving constant feed back from our guests about how great and we'll thought-out the music selection was.

And lastly to the the chef and his team - JUST WOW! The guests were blow away by every single dish prepared.

However, Tidimalo was completely on the ball! She picked up on everything last minute, and made sure that every detail of our event was perfect. She thought of things I had not even considered myself - and she made our event so stress-free and gorgeous. Everybody raved about how beautiful it was - all thanks to lovely Tidimalo.

"Awesome Service From Prepaid24 We had technicians of City Power replace our prepaid meter last week, for reasons unknown. I was told that the registration of the meter would be taken care of by City Power, but after a week when I tried to purchase credit, it became evident that City Power had obviously not done the job. After two frustrating and fruitless visits to my nearest City Power Depot, I still had no idea whether or not they were going to register the new meter number. Subsequently, I got hold of Cecile at Prepaid24, who sorted out the problem within half an hour. She even phoned to ensure that she had all the right details. Well done Cecile and by extension Prepaid24, for amazing service! Perhaps you could give the employees of City Power some training in service and professionalism?",1,5,2

This proved to be the most user friendlt experience ever. Thank You Michaela.,1,5,1
"Laurenz Assistantance twice Laurenz, helped me on 2 occasions, and I am very very happy. I had an issue with the municipality and Laurenz assisted me to get my refund, which I did. I am so overwhelmed with a sense of fantastic service. I wish that prepaid 24 staff could work at the municipality. It's disgusting how we as paying clients that are trying to survive get treated. I must say prepaid 24 service and friendly, helpful staff like Laurenz really go all out. Thank you leaps and bounds Laurenz for helping me and your fantastic services. Atleast there is a live chat, maybe the municipality should follow the services of prepaid 24 staff. Thank you again Laurenz. Kindest Regards Carrie.",1,5,2

All 3 token numbers must be entered in the correct sequence for it to work. The 1st 2 immediately one after the other. Then pause and then enter the last token number. That should then recharge your electricity correctly. 
A HUGE THANK YOU to Michaela for assisting me to load my recharge token before my electricity ran out!!",1,5,1
